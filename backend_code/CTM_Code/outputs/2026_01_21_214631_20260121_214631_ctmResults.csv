COVID-19 is a global public health emergency of international concern. COVID-19 causes mild to severe illness with high morbidity and mortality, especially in preexisting risk groups. Therapeutic options are now limited to COVID-19. The hallmark of COVID-19 pathogenesis is the cytokine storm with elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), chemokine (C-C-motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia, and neurological disorders, including stroke, the damage to the neurovascular unit, blood-brain barrier disruption, high intracranial proinflammatory cytokines, and endothelial cell damage in the brain. Mast cells are innate immune cells and also implicated in adaptive immune response, systemic inflammatory diseases, neuroinflammatory diseases, traumatic brain injury and stroke, and stress disorders. SARS-CoV-2 can activate monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, mast cells, neutrophils, and induce cytokine storm in the lung. COVID-19 can activate mast cells, neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause psychological stress and neuroinflammation. In conclusion, COVID-19 can induce mast cell activation, psychological stress, cytokine storm, and neuroinflammation.","Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is highly regulated by a number of environmental and cell-intrinsic factors to adapt to environmental changes. Accumulating evidence suggests that adult-born neurons may play distinct physiological roles in hippocampus-dependent functions, such as memory encoding and mood regulation. In addition, several brain diseases, such as neurological diseases and mood disorders, have deleterious effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and some symptoms of those diseases can be partially explained by the dysregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we review a possible link between the physiological functions of adult-born neurons and their roles in pathological conditions.","Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most frequent side effects caused by antineoplastic agents, with a prevalence from 19% to over 85%. Clinically, CIPN is a mostly sensory neuropathy that may be accompanied by motor and autonomic changes of varying intensity and duration. Due to its high prevalence among cancer patients, CIPN constitutes a major problem for both cancer patients and survivors as well as for their health care providers, especially because, at the moment, there is no single effective method of preventing CIPN; moreover, the possibilities of treating this syndrome are very limited. There are six main substance groups that cause damage to peripheral sensory, motor and autonomic neurons, which result in the development of CIPN: platinum-based antineoplastic agents, vinca alkaloids, epothilones (ixabepilone), taxanes, proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib) and immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide). Among them, the most neurotoxic are platinum-based agents, taxanes, ixabepilone and thalidomide; other less neurotoxic but also commonly used drugs are bortezomib and vinca alkaloids. This paper reviews the clinical picture of CIPN and the neurotoxicity mechanisms of the most common antineoplastic agents. A better understanding of the risk factors and underlying mechanisms of CIPN is needed to develop effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has turned the world into chaos with its ominously high rate of transmissions. As the SARS-CoV-2 infection has become pandemic, the scientific community is in a race against time to beat the COVID19 by unraveling molecular targets and discover epitopes in the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 for vaccines/antibodies synthesis. It has been reported that in addition to the conventional respiratory complains of flu, patients are also exhibiting neurological signs and symptoms. Recently, the report of a patient with COVID-19 exhibiting loss of the involuntary process of breathing1 controlled by the inspiratory area in the brainstem, is alarming. Additionally, neurological deficits reported in uncomplicated and complicated patients with COVID-192 from hospitals in Wuhan, China, are convincing enough that the neurological deficits could be ongoing in the recent outbreak without getting noticed. As the recent outbreak has now spread to almost all of the continents and has become pandemic, we are in the early phases of our attempts to understand the syndromic complexity of the COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 can take two pathways to involve the brain (Figure 1). Early occurrences of loss of smell, ataxia, and convulsions should be further evaluated for CNS involvement by SARS-CoV-2. The clinicians throughout the world in general, and Wuhan, China, in particular, are getting the firsthand to study and report the real-time clinical presentations of the patients affected by COVID19. The prognostic and diagnostic significance of neurological sign and symptoms in COVID-19 patients can be gauged by fact that the protocol designed to investigate the First Few X cases (FFX) and their close contacts by the World Health Organization (WHO), includes a separate section for “other neurological signs” in addition to separate columns for respiratory symptoms.3 Additionally, reports of COVID-19-affected individuals experiencing convulsions in prevalent areas is alarming and need to be distinguished from febrile convolution that is expected to occur with high-grade fever in patients with COVID-19. Our experience with taxonomically related SARS-CoV patients in the past has proven beyond doubt the coronaviruses to affect the brain. Of many examples from the past, was a case where SARS-CoV was isolated from the brain of a patient who had exhibited features of neurological deficits on 28th day of infection.4 In past outbreaks with SARS-CoV, it has been shown that it targets the CNS5 and the reports that the brain also is an additional target of SARS-CoV4 raises the possibility of the presentation of more patients with neurological manifestations in the ongoing outbreak of COIVD-19. Also, SARS-CoV has been isolated from brain tissue with edema and neuronal degeneration as seen at autopsies with immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopic confirmation of viral infection of the neurons.6 It would not be surprising to see the COVID-19 virus following the same trend as both viruses are near identical taxonomically. As the pandemic is in effect at present, a detailed timeline of the syndromic neurological manifestation in COVID-19 will emerge as more studies get published on complicated and uncomplicated cases of COVID-19. Though the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the CNS invasion will be revealed in time, there is an urgent need to distinguish between neurologically affected CVOID-19 patients and those who do not exhibit the sign and symptoms of CNS involvement. The hematogenous route appears to be the likely pathway for SARS-CoV-2 to reach the brain, but other routes to the CNS like across the cribriform plate (Figure 1B) of the ethmoid bone in proximity to the olfactory bulb7 should be taken into consideration in cases of early-phase COVID-19-affected patients who exhibit loss of smell and taste accompanied with neurological signs and symptoms. Studies believe that direct SARS-CoV infection of the human CNS does occur in some patients.8 It is also important to mention here that the neurological signs and symptoms observed in the COVID-19 cases could be a manifestation of hypoxia, respiratory, and metabolic acidosis at an advanced stage of the disease, but reasonably, a differential diagnosis of these cases is needed, which could prove lifesaving. The later distinction also appears to be important from the vantage point of selecting a treatment regimen, as management of the COVID-19 cases with neurological involvement would require more specific and aggressive treatments as compared to the patients without it. The significance of a thorough neurological assessment of COVID19 patients cannot be overemphasized which can rule-in or rule out a neurological deficit of a patient admitted after serological tests confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19. Presence of neurological deficits","Energy demand of neurons in brain that is covered by glucose supply from the blood is ensured by glucose transporters in capillaries and brain cells. In brain, the facilitative diffusion glucose transporters GLUT1-6 and GLUT8, and the Na+-d-glucose cotransporters SGLT1 are expressed. The glucose transporters mediate uptake of d-glucose across the blood-brain barrier and delivery of d-glucose to astrocytes and neurons. They are critically involved in regulatory adaptations to varying energy demands in response to differing neuronal activities and glucose supply. In this review, a comprehensive overview about verified and proposed roles of cerebral glucose transporters during health and diseases is presented. Our current knowledge is mainly based on experiments performed in rodents. First, the functional properties of human glucose transporters expressed in brain and their cerebral locations are described. Thereafter, proposed physiological functions of GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4, and SGLT1 for energy supply to neurons, glucose sensing, central regulation of glucohomeostasis, and feeding behavior are compiled, and their roles in learning and memory formation are discussed. In addition, diseases are described in which functional changes of cerebral glucose transporters are relevant. These are GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-SD), diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). GLUT1-SD is caused by defect mutations in GLUT1. Diabetes and AD are associated with changed expression of glucose transporters in brain, and transporter-related energy deficiency of neurons may contribute to pathogenesis of AD. Stroke and TBI are associated with changes of glucose transporter expression that influence clinical outcome.","We report the implantation of patient-derived midbrain dopaminergic progenitor cells, differentiated in vitro from autologous induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in a patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The patient-specific progenitor cells were produced under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions and characterized as having the phenotypic properties of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons; testing in a humanized mouse model (involving peripheral-blood mononuclear cells) indicated an absence of immunogenicity to these cells. The cells were implanted into the putamen (left hemisphere followed by right hemisphere, 6 months apart) of a patient with Parkinson's disease, without the need for immunosuppression. Positron-emission tomography with the use of fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine suggested graft survival. Clinical measures of symptoms of Parkinson's disease after surgery stabilized or improved at 18 to 24 months after implantation. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).","Microglia, the brain’s resident macrophages, help to regulate brain function by removing dying neurons, pruning non-functional synapses, and producing ligands that support neuronal survival 1 . Here we show that microglia are also critical modulators of neuronal activity and associated behavioural responses in mice. Microglia respond to neuronal activation by suppressing neuronal activity, and ablation of microglia amplifies and synchronizes the activity of neurons, leading to seizures. Suppression of neuronal activation by microglia occurs in a highly region-specific fashion and depends on the ability of microglia to sense and catabolize extracellular ATP, which is released upon neuronal activation by neurons and astrocytes. ATP triggers the recruitment of microglial protrusions and is converted by the microglial ATP/ADP hydrolysing ectoenzyme CD39 into AMP; AMP is then converted into adenosine by CD73, which is expressed on microglia as well as other brain cells. Microglial sensing of ATP, the ensuing microglia-dependent production of adenosine, and the adenosine-mediated suppression of neuronal responses via the adenosine receptor A 1 R are essential for the regulation of neuronal activity and animal behaviour. Our findings suggest that this microglia-driven negative feedback mechanism operates similarly to inhibitory neurons and is essential for protecting the brain from excessive activation in health and disease. Microglia, the brain’s immune cells, suppress neuronal activity in response to synaptic ATP release and alter behavioural responses in mice.","Synaptic homeostasis of the principal neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA is tightly regulated by an intricate metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes known as the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle. In this cycle, astrocytes take up glutamate and GABA from the synapse and convert these neurotransmitters into glutamine. Astrocytic glutamine is subsequently transferred to neurons, serving as the principal precursor for neuronal glutamate and GABA synthesis. The glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle integrates multiple cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release, uptake, synthesis, and metabolism. All of these processes are deeply interdependent and closely coupled to cellular energy metabolism. Astrocytes display highly active mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and several unique metabolic features, including glycogen storage and pyruvate carboxylation, which are essential to sustain continuous glutamine release. However, new roles of oligodendrocytes and microglia in neurotransmitter recycling are emerging. Malfunction of the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle can lead to severe synaptic disruptions and may be implicated in several brain diseases. Here, I review central aspects and recent advances of the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle to highlight how the cycle is functionally connected to critical brain functions and metabolism. First, an overview of glutamate, GABA, and glutamine transport is provided in relation to neurotransmitter recycling. Then, central metabolic aspects of the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle are reviewed, with a special emphasis on the critical metabolic roles of glial cells. Finally, I discuss how aberrant neurotransmitter recycling is linked to neurodegeneration and disease, focusing on astrocyte metabolic dysfunction and brain lipid homeostasis as emerging pathological mechanisms. Instead of viewing the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle as individual biochemical processes, a more holistic and integrative approach is needed to advance our understanding of how neurotransmitter recycling modulates brain function in both health and disease.","The gut–brain axis represents an important bidirectional communication network, with the vagus nerve acting as a central conduit for peripheral signals from the various gut organs to the central nervous system. Among the molecular mediators involved, serotonin (5-HT), synthesized predominantly by enterochromaffin cells in the gut, plays a pivotal role. Gut-derived serotonin activates vagal afferent fibers, transmitting signals to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and modulating serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) as well as the norepinephrinergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC). This interaction influences emotional regulation, stress responses, and immune modulation. Emerging evidence also highlights the role of microbial metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in enhancing serotonin synthesis and vagal activity, thereby shaping gut–brain communication. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on serotonin signaling, vagal nerve pathways, and central autonomic regulation, with an emphasis on their implications for neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders. By elucidating these pathways, novel therapeutic strategies targeting the gut–brain axis may be developed to improve mental and physical health outcomes.","The emerging field of organic bioelectronics bridges the electronic world of organic-semiconductor-based devices with the soft, predominantly ionic world of biology. This crosstalk can occur in both directions. For example, a biochemical reaction may change the doping state of an organic material, generating an electronic readout. Conversely, an electronic signal from a device may stimulate a biological event. Cutting-edge research in this field results in the development of a broad variety of meaningful applications, from biosensors and drug delivery systems to health monitoring devices and brain-machine interfaces. Conjugated polymers share similarities in chemical ""nature"" with biological molecules and can be engineered on various forms, including hydrogels that have Young's moduli similar to those of soft tissues and are ionically conducting. The structure of organic materials can be tuned through synthetic chemistry, and their biological properties can be controlled using a variety of functionalization strategies. Finally, organic electronic materials can be integrated with a variety of mechanical supports, giving rise to devices with form factors that enable integration with biological systems. While these developments are innovative and promising, it is important to note that the field is still in its infancy, with many unknowns and immense scope for exploration and highly collaborative research. The first part of this Account details the unique properties that render conjugated polymers excellent biointerfacing materials. We then offer an overview of the most common conjugated polymers that have been used as active layers in various organic bioelectronics devices, highlighting the importance of developing new materials. These materials are the most popular ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives as well as conjugated polyelectrolytes and ion-free organic semiconductors functionalized for the biological interface. We then discuss several applications and operation principles of state-of-the-art bioelectronics devices. These devices include electrodes applied to sense/trigger electrophysiological activity of cells as well as electrolyte-gated field-effect and electrochemical transistors used for sensing of biochemical markers. Another prime application example of conjugated polymers is cell actuators. External modulation of the redox state of the underlying conjugated polymer films controls the adhesion behavior and viability of cells. These smart surfaces can be also designed in the form of three-dimensional architectures because of the processability of conjugated polymers. As such, cell-loaded scaffolds based on electroactive polymers enable integrated sensing or stimulation within the engineered tissue itself. A last application example is organic neuromorphic devices, an alternative computing architecture that takes inspiration from biology and, in particular, from the way the brain works. Leveraging ion redistribution inside a conjugated polymer upon application of an electrical field and its coupling with electronic charges, conjugated polymers can be engineered to act as artificial neurons or synapses with complex, history-dependent behavior. We conclude this Account by highlighting main factors that need to be considered for the design of a conjugated polymer for applications in bioelectronics-although there can be various figures of merit given the broad range of applications, as emphasized in this Account.",28.1124845021006,Humanitarian Medical Response
2,disease; age; neurodegenerative; protein; function; pathway; role; review; include; increase; therapeutic; alzheimers_disease; mechanism; alzheimers; potential,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on tau have long been recognized as affecting protein function and contributing to neurodegeneration. The explosion of information on potential and observed PTMs on tau provides an opportunity to better understand these modifications in the context of tau homeostasis, which becomes perturbed with aging and disease. Prevailing views regard tau as a protein that undergoes abnormal phosphorylation prior to its accumulation into the toxic aggregates implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. However, the phosphorylation of tau may, in fact, represent part of the normal but interrupted function and catabolism of the protein. In addition to phosphorylation, tau undergoes another forms of post-translational modification including (but not limited to), acetylation, ubiquitination, glycation, glycosylation, SUMOylation, methylation, oxidation, and nitration. A holistic appreciation of how these PTMs regulate tau during health and are potentially hijacked in disease remains elusive. Recent studies have reinforced the idea that PTMs play a critical role in tau localization, protein-protein interactions, maintenance of levels, and modifying aggregate structure. These studies also provide tantalizing clues into the possibility that neurons actively choose how tau is post-translationally modified, in potentially competitive and combinatorial ways, to achieve broad, cellular programs commensurate with the distinctive environmental conditions found during development, aging, stress, and disease. Here, we review tau PTMs and describe what is currently known about their functional impacts. In addition, we classify these PTMs from the perspectives of protein localization, electrostatics, and stability, which all contribute to normal tau function and homeostasis. Finally, we assess the potential impact of tau PTMs on tau solubility and aggregation. Tau occupies an undoubtedly important position in the biology of neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to provide an integrated perspective of how post-translational modifications actively, purposefully, and dynamically remodel tau function, clearance, and aggregation. In doing so, we hope to enable a more comprehensive understanding of tau PTMs that will positively impact future studies.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder without a cure. Most AD cases are sporadic where age represents the greatest risk factor. Lack of understanding of the disease mechanism hinders the development of efficacious therapeutic approaches. The loss of synapses in the affected brain regions correlates best with cognitive impairment in AD patients and has been considered as the early mechanism that precedes neuronal loss. Oxidative stress has been recognized as a contributing factor in aging and in the progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with age- and disease-dependent loss of mitochondrial function, altered metal homeostasis, and reduced antioxidant defense directly affect synaptic activity and neurotransmission in neurons leading to cognitive dysfunction. In addition, molecular targets affected by ROS include nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, lipids, proteins, calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics and function, cellular architecture, receptor trafficking and endocytosis, and energy homeostasis. Abnormal cellular metabolism in turn could affect the production and accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, which independently could exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production, thereby contributing to a vicious cycle. While mounting evidence implicates ROS in the AD etiology, clinical trials with antioxidant therapies have not produced consistent results. In this review, we will discuss the role of oxidative stress in synaptic dysfunction in AD, innovative therapeutic strategies evolved based on a better understanding of the complexity of molecular mechanisms of AD, and the dual role ROS play in health and disease.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are two typical neurodegenerative diseases that increased with aging. With the emergence of aging population, the health problem and economic burden caused by the two diseases also increase. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway regulates signal transduction and biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism. According to reports, it regulates neurotoxicity and mediates the survival of neurons through different substrates such as forkhead box protein Os (FoxOs), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and caspase-9. Accumulating evidences indicate that some natural products can play a neuroprotective role by activating PI3K/AKT pathway, providing an effective resource for the discovery of potential therapeutic drugs. This article reviews the relationship between AKT signaling pathway and AD and PD, and discusses the potential natural products based on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to treat two diseases in recent years, hoping to provide guidance and reference for this field. Further development of Chinese herbal medicine is needed to treat these two diseases.","Age is the main risk factor for a number of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which increasing numbers of elderly individuals suffer. These pathological conditions are characterized by progressive loss of neuron cells, compromised motor or cognitive functions, and accumulation of abnormally aggregated proteins. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the main features of the aging process, particularly in organs requiring a high-energy source such as the heart, muscles, brain, or liver. Neurons rely almost exclusively on the mitochondria, which produce the energy required for most of the cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter synthesis. The brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and damage, because of its high oxygen consumption, low antioxidant defenses, and high content of polyunsaturated fats very prone to be oxidized. Thus, it is not surprising the importance of protecting systems, including antioxidant defenses, to maintain neuronal integrity and survival. Here, we review the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in the aging process, with a specific focus on neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involving mitochondria and oxidative stress in the aging and neurodegeneration may help to identify new strategies for improving the health and extending lifespan.","Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by progressive damage to the nervous system including the selective loss of vulnerable populations of neurons leading to motor symptoms and cognitive decline. Despite millions of people being affected worldwide, there are still no drugs that block the neurodegenerative process to stop or slow disease progression. Neuronal death in these diseases is often linked to the misfolded proteins that aggregate within the brain (proteinopathies) as a result of disease-related gene mutations or abnormal protein homoeostasis. There are two major degradation pathways to rid a cell of unwanted or misfolded proteins to prevent their accumulation and to maintain the health of a cell: the ubiquitin–proteasome system and the autophagy–lysosomal pathway. Both of these degradative pathways depend on the modification of targets with ubiquitin. Aging is the primary risk factor of most neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. With aging there is a general reduction in proteasomal degradation and autophagy, and a consequent increase of potentially neurotoxic protein aggregates of β-amyloid, tau, α-synuclein, SOD1 and TDP-43. An often over-looked yet major component of these aggregates is ubiquitin, implicating these protein aggregates as either an adaptive response to toxic misfolded proteins or as evidence of dysregulated ubiquitin-mediated degradation driving toxic aggregation. In addition, non-degradative ubiquitin signalling is critical for homoeostatic mechanisms fundamental for neuronal function and survival, including mitochondrial homoeostasis, receptor trafficking and DNA damage responses, whilst also playing a role in inflammatory processes. This review will discuss the current understanding of the role of ubiquitin-dependent processes in the progressive loss of neurons and the emergence of ubiquitin signalling as a target for the development of much needed new drugs to treat neurodegenerative disease.","Polyphenols are found ubiquitously in plants and their regular consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of a number of chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurodegenerative disorders. Rather than exerting direct antioxidant effects, the mechanisms by which polyphenols express these beneficial properties appear to involve their interaction with cellular signaling pathways and related machinery that mediate cell function under both normal and pathological conditions. We illustrate that their interactions with two such pathways, the MAP kinase (ERK, JNK, p38) and PI3 kinase/Akt signaling cascades, allow them to impact upon normal and abnormal cell function, thus influencing the cellular processes involved in the initiation and progression of cancer, CVD and neurodegeneration. For example, their ability to activate ERK in neurons leads to a promotion of neuronal survival and cognitive enhancements, both of which influence the progression of Alzheimer's disease, whilst ERK activation by polyphenols in vascular endothelial cells influences nitric oxide production, blood pressure and ultimately CVD risk. The main focus of this review is to provide an overview of the role that polyphenols play in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. We present epidemiological data, human intervention study findings, as well as animal and in vitro studies in support of these actions and in each case we consider how their actions at the cellular level may underpin their physiological effects.","The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has become one of the cornerstones of neuropathology, influencing synaptic plasticity, cognitive resilience, and neuronal survival. Apart from its molecular biology, BDNF is a powerful target for transformative benefit in precision medicine, leading to innovative therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Nevertheless, clinical applicability is obstructed by hurdles in delivery, patient-specific diversity, and pleiotropic signaling. Here, we summarize findings in BDNF research, including its regulatory pathways and diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and integrative therapeutic approaches. We describe innovative delivery systems, such as lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA therapies and CRISPR-dCas9-based epigenetic editing that bypass obstacles such as BBB (blood–brain barrier) and enzymatic degradation. The recent implementation of multiplex panels combining BDNF biodynamic indicators with tau and amyloid-β signaling markers showcases novel levels of specificity for both early detection and potential therapeutic monitoring. Humanized preclinical models like iPSC-derived neurons and organoids point to the key role of BDNF in neurodeveloping and neurodegenerative processes, paralleling advances in bridging preclinical observation and clinical environments. Moreover, novel therapeutic tools delivering TrkB activators or the implementation of AI-based dynamic care platforms enable tailored and scalable treatments. This review also aims to extend a framework used in the understanding of BDNF’s relevance to traditional neurodegenerative models by situating more recent work detailing BDNF’s actions in ischemic tissues and the gut–brain axis in the context of systemic health. Finally, we outline a roadmap for the incorporation of BDNF-centered therapies into worldwide healthcare, highlighting ethical issues, equity, and interdisciplinary decomposition. The therapeutic potential of BDNF heralds a new era in neuroscience and medicine, revolutionizing brain health and paving the way for the advancement of precision medicine.","The aging of the global population has increased the prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions. Bacopa monnieri (BM), an herb with active compounds, such as bacosides A and B, betulinic acid, loliolide, asiatic acid, and quercetin, demonstrates the potential for brain health. Limited research has been conducted on the therapeutic applications of BM in neurodegenerative conditions. This systematic review aims to project BM’s beneficial role in brain disorders. BM has anti-apoptotic and antioxidant actions and can repair damaged neurons, stimulate kinase activity, restore synaptic function, improve nerve transmission, and increase neuroprotection. The included twenty-two clinical trials demonstrated that BM can reduce Nuclear Factor-κB phosphorylation, improve emotional function, cognitive functions, anhedonia, hyperactivity, sleep routine, depression, attention deficit, learning problems, memory retention, impulsivity, and psychiatric problems. Moreover, BM can reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers and oxidative stress. Here, we highlight that BM provides notable therapeutic benefits and can serve as a complementary approach for the care of patients with neurodegenerative conditions associated with brain disorders. This review adds to the growing interest in natural products and their potential therapeutic applications by improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying cognitive function and neurodegeneration and informing the development of new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.","Tauopathies are a broad set of neurodegenerative dementias characterized by aggregation of the tau protein into filamentous inclusions that can be found in neurons and glial cells. Activated microglia, astrocytes and elevated levels of proinflammatory molecules are also pathological hallmarks that are found in brain regions affected by tau pathology. There has been abundant research in recent years to understand the role of gliosis and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) which is the most common form of dementia. AD is a tauopathy characterized by both extracellular amyloid-β plaques in addition to intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads containing aggregated tau protein. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuroinflammation offers a possible mechanistic link between these pathologies. Additionally, there appears to be a role for neuroinflammation in aggravating tau pathology and neurodegeneration in tauopathies featuring tau deposits as the predominant pathological signature. In this review, we survey the literature regarding inflammatory mechanisms that may impact neurodegeneration in AD and related tauopathies. We consider a physical role for microglia in the spread of tau pathology as well as the non-cell autonomous effects of secreted proinflammatory cytokines, specifically interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha and complement proteins. These molecules appear to have direct effects on tau pathophysiology and overall neuronal health. They also indirectly impact neuronal homeostasis by altering glial function. We conclude by proposing a complex role for gliosis and neuroinflammation in accelerating the progression of AD and other tauopathies.","A reduced removal of dysfunctional mitochondria is common to aging and age-related neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Strategies for treating such impaired mitophagy would benefit from the identification of mitophagy modulators. Here we report the combined use of unsupervised machine learning (involving vector representations of molecular structures, pharmacophore fingerprinting and conformer fingerprinting) and a cross-species approach for the screening and experimental validation of new mitophagy-inducing compounds. From a library of naturally occurring compounds, the workflow allowed us to identify 18 small molecules, and among them two potent mitophagy inducers (Kaempferol and Rhapontigenin). In nematode and rodent models of AD, we show that both mitophagy inducers increased the survival and functionality of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons, abrogated amyloid-β and tau pathologies, and improved the animals’ memory. Our findings suggest the existence of a conserved mechanism of memory loss across the AD models, this mechanism being mediated by defective mitophagy. The computational–experimental screening and validation workflow might help uncover potent mitophagy modulators that stimulate neuronal health and brain homeostasis. Two potent mitophagy inducers, identified and characterized via unsupervised machine learning and a cross-species screening approach, ameliorated the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease in worms and mice.",20.0809602942241,Neurodegenerative Disease Research

However, the explosion of physiological signal data presents challenges for traditional systems. Here, we propose a highly efficient neuromorphic physiological signal processing system based on VO2 memristors. The volatile and positive/negative symmetric threshold switching characteristics of VO2 memristors are leveraged to construct a sparse-spiking yet high-fidelity asynchronous spike encoder for physiological signals. Besides, the dynamical behavior of VO2 memristors is utilized in compact Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) and Adaptive-LIF (ALIF) neurons, which are incorporated into a decision-making Long short-term memory Spiking Neural Network. The system demonstrates superior computing capabilities, needing only small-sized LSNNs to attain high accuracies of 95.83% and 99.79% in arrhythmia classification and epileptic seizure detection, respectively. This work highlights the potential of memristors in constructing efficient neuromorphic physiological signal processing systems and promoting next-generation human-machine interfaces.","The brain is characterized by heterogeneous patterns of structural connections supporting unparalleled feats of cognition and a wide range of behaviours. New non-invasive imaging techniques now allow comprehensive mapping of these patterns. However, a fundamental challenge remains to understand how the brain’s structural wiring supports cognitive processes, with major implications for personalized mental health treatments. Here, we review recent efforts to meet this challenge, drawing on physics intuitions, models and theories, spanning the domains of statistical mechanics, information theory, dynamical systems and control. We first describe the organizing principles of brain network architecture instantiated in structural wiring under constraints of spatial embedding and energy minimization. We then survey models of brain network function that stipulate how neural activity propagates along structural connections. Finally, we discuss perturbative experiments and models for brain network control; these use the physics of signal transmission along structural connections to infer intrinsic control processes that support goal-directed behaviour and to inform stimulation-based therapies for neurological and psychiatric disease. Throughout, we highlight open questions that invite the creative efforts of pioneering physicists.The brain is the quintessential complex system, boasting incredible feats of cognition and supporting a wide range of behaviours. Physics has much to offer in the quest to distil the brain’s complexity to a number of cogent organizing principles.Key pointsFrom the first measurement of the nerve impulse by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1849 to the cutting-edge superconducting devices used in magnetoencephalography, physics and neuroscience have always been inextricably linked.Today, network neuroscience — the study of the brain as a complex web of interacting components — draws intuitions and techniques from nearly every branch of physics.The architecture of structural connections between neurons or brain regions is constrained by requirements of energy minimization and efficient information transfer.The materialization of long-range correlations and synchronization from the collective firing of individual neurons conjures notions of emergence and criticality from statistical mechanics.Together, these investigations of brain network structure and function guide targeted treatments for cognitive disorders using theories of network control.Now more than ever, understanding the complexities of the mind lies at the feet of curious and pioneering physicists.","Mediating systemic health Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an important circulating lipid mediator that is derived from the metabolism of cell membranes. Its diverse homeostatic roles, particularly in immunology and vascular biology, can go awry in numerous diseases, including multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, and fibrosis. The centrality of S1P signaling has led to the development of several drugs, including two approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis. In a Review, Cartier and Hla discuss the current understanding of how one mediator can carry out so many signaling roles in different tissues, how these become dysregulated in disease, and efforts in drug development to target S1P signaling. Science, this issue p. eaar5551 BACKGROUND Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a product of membrane sphingolipid metabolism, is secreted and acts through G protein–coupled S1P receptors (S1PRs) in vertebrates. S1PR isoforms mediate complex cellular actions either alone or in combination in most organ systems. This stable lysolipid circulates as a complex with protein chaperones that not only enables aqueous solubility but also helps facilitate specific modes of receptor signaling. However, differential concentration gradients of S1P are normally present in various compartments and are perturbed under disease conditions. The abundance of circulatory S1P and the high expression of S1PRs in exposed cells—that is, vascular and hematopoietic cells—poses a key question of how this signaling axis is regulated. This question is of clinical relevance because the first S1PR-targeted drug, fingolimod, has been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis since 2010. Recent findings from basic research as well as insights gleaned from clinical and translational studies have enriched our understanding of how this simple lysolipid evolved as a complex regulator of multiple physiological systems and, when dysregulated, contributes to numerous diseases. ADVANCES Extracellular spatial gradients of S1P, demonstrated by using S1P reporters, are tightly regulated and control fundamental processes such as hematopoietic cell trafficking, immune cell fate, and vascular integrity. The gradients are formed through location-specific function of metabolic enzymes, S1P transporters, and chaperones. Such physiological S1P gradients are altered in diseases, thus contributing to conditions such as inflammation, autoimmunity, and vascular dysfunction. S1P complexed to chaperone proteins—for example, high-density lipoprotein–bound apolipoprotein M—mediate distinct modes of receptor activation, resulting in biased receptor signaling and specific biological outcomes. S1PRs are also regulated tightly through endocytic mechanisms and receptor modulators that enhance or inhibit signal strength and duration. Various signaling mechanisms of this simple lysolipid mediator has helped reveal its multiple actions in the immune system, which include adaptive immune cell localization in various compartments (egress versus retention), fate switching, survival, and activation that influences both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. In the cardiovascular system, high expression of multiple S1PR isoforms in various cell types regulate development, homeostasis, and physiology. Current S1PR-targeted drugs that aim to tame autoimmunity exhibit considerable cardiovascular-adverse events. In the central nervous system (CNS), widespread application of S1PR-targeted drugs in autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases has stimulated research that revealed the broad but poorly understood effects of S1P signaling in neurodevelopment, the neurovascular unit, neurons, and glia. Furthermore, in addition to the involvement of pathological S1P signaling in acute ischemic conditions of various organs, chronic dysregulated S1P signaling has been implicated in fibrotic diseases of lung, heart, liver, and kidney. OUTLOOK Considerable challenges remain to fully harness the new knowledge in S1P pathobiology to translational utility in clinical medicine. Approaches that mimic S1P chaperones, S1P neutralizing agents, modulation of transporters, biased agonists and antagonists of S1PR isotypes, and sphingolipid metabolic enzyme modulators provide viable pathways to therapy. Focusing on the immune system, such approaches may widen the autoimmunity therapeutic landscape and provide new directions in cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. For cardiovascular diseases, ischemic conditions as well as chronic heart failure are likely candidates for future translational efforts. Although further work is needed, S1P-targeted approaches may also be useful in regenerative therapies for the aging and diseased myocardium. The CNS-targeted efforts may cross into neurodegenerative diseases, given the success with S1PR-targeted drugs in reducing brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis. Other potential applications include approaches in pain management and neurodevelopmental disorders. Such strategies, although challenging, are greatly helped by findings from basic research on S1P pathobiology as well as pharmacological and clinical insights derived from the application of S1P-targeted therapeutics. S1PR signaling regulates multiorgan pathophysiological processes. Extracellular S1P gradients created by transporters, chaperones (ApoM+HDL), and metabolic enzymes (LPP3) interact with S1PRs on the cell surface. Receptor activity, transmitted by means of G proteins, is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including β-arrestin coupling, endocytosis, and receptor modulators. The resultant cellular changes influence multiple organ systems in physiology and disease. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a metabolic product of cell membrane sphingolipids, is bound to extracellular chaperones, is enriched in circulatory fluids, and binds to G protein–coupled S1P receptors (S1PRs) to regulate embryonic development, postnatal organ function, and disease. S1PRs regulate essential processes such as adaptive immune cell trafficking, vascular development, and homeostasis. Moreover, S1PR signaling is a driver of multiple diseases. The past decade has witnessed an exponential growth in this field, in part because of multidisciplinary research focused on this lipid mediator and the application of S1PR-targeted drugs in clinical medicine. This has revealed fundamental principles of lysophospholipid mediator signaling that not only clarify the complex and wide ranging actions of S1P but also guide the development of therapeutics and translational directions in immunological, cardiovascular, neurological, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases.","Feelings of hunger and satiety are the key determinants for maintaining the life of humans and animals. Disturbed appetite control may disrupt the metabolic health of the host and cause various metabolic disorders. A variety of factors have been implicated in appetite control, including gut microbiota, which develop the intricate interactions to manipulate the metabolic requirements and hedonic feelings. Gut microbial metabolites and components act as appetite-related signaling molecules to regulate appetite-related hormone secretion and the immune system, or act directly on hypothalamic neurons. Herein, we summarize the effects of gut microbiota on host appetite and consider the potential molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose that the manipulation of gut microbiota represents a clinical therapeutic potential for lessening the development and consequence of appetite-related disorders. Euffm8RKdwQpaRBJkQtTtQ Video abstract Video abstract","Our brain serves as a center for cognitive function and neurons within the brain relay and store information about our surroundings and experiences. Modulation of this complex neuronal circuitry allows us to process that information and respond appropriately. Proper development of neurons is therefore vital to the mental health of an individual, and perturbations in their signaling or morphology are likely to result in cognitive impairment. The development of a neuron requires a series of steps that begins with migration from its birth place and initiation of process outgrowth, and ultimately leads to differentiation and the formation of connections that allow it to communicate with appropriate targets. Over the past several years, it has become clear that the Rho family of GTPases and related molecules play an important role in various aspects of neuronal development, including neurite outgrowth and differentiation, axon pathfinding, and dendritic spine formation and maintenance. Given the importance of these molecules in these processes, it is therefore not surprising that mutations in genes encoding a number of regulators and effectors of the Rho GTPases have been associated with human neurological diseases. This review will focus on the role of the Rho GTPases and their associated signaling molecules throughout neuronal development and discuss how perturbations in Rho GTPase signaling may lead to cognitive disorders.","Background Alzheimer disease (AD) is a major health problem of aging, with tremendous burden on healthcare systems, patients, and families globally. Lecanemab, an FDA-approved amyloid beta (Aβ)-directed antibody indicated for the treatment of early AD, binds with high affinity to soluble Aβ protofibrils, which have been shown to be more toxic to neurons than monomers or insoluble fibrils. Lecanemab has been shown to be well tolerated in multiple clinical trials, although risks include an increased rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions relative to placebo. Methods Clarity AD was an 18-month treatment (Core study), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with open-label extension (OLE) in participants with early AD. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly). Safety evaluations included monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. ARIA occurrence was monitored throughout the study by magnetic resonance imaging, read both locally and centrally. Results Overall, 1795 participants from Core and 1612 participants with at least one dose of lecanemab (Core + OLE) were included. Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in Clarity AD, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the Core study. There were 9 deaths during the OLE, with 4 deemed possibly related to study treatment. Of the 24 deaths in Core + OLE, 3 were due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): 1 placebo in the Core due to ICH, and 2 lecanemab in OLE with concurrent ICH (1 on tissue plasminogen activator and 1 on anticoagulant therapy). In the Core + OLE, the most common adverse events in the lecanemab group (> 10%) were infusion-related reactions (24.5%), ARIA with hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) microhemorrhages (16.0%), COVID-19 (14.7%), ARIA with edema (ARIA-E; 13.6%), and headache (10.3%). ARIA-E and ARIA-H were largely radiographically mild-to-moderate. ARIA-E generally occurred within 3–6 months of treatment, was more common in ApoE e4 carriers (16.8%) and most common in ApoE ε4 homozygous participants (34.5%). Conclusions Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions, ARIA-H, ARIA-E. Clinicians, participants, and caregivers should understand the incidence, monitoring, and management of these events for optimal patient care. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov numbers: Clarity AD NCT03887455)","The emerging field of organic bioelectronics bridges the electronic world of organic-semiconductor-based devices with the soft, predominantly ionic world of biology. This crosstalk can occur in both directions. For example, a biochemical reaction may change the doping state of an organic material, generating an electronic readout. Conversely, an electronic signal from a device may stimulate a biological event. Cutting-edge research in this field results in the development of a broad variety of meaningful applications, from biosensors and drug delivery systems to health monitoring devices and brain-machine interfaces. Conjugated polymers share similarities in chemical ""nature"" with biological molecules and can be engineered on various forms, including hydrogels that have Young's moduli similar to those of soft tissues and are ionically conducting. The structure of organic materials can be tuned through synthetic chemistry, and their biological properties can be controlled using a variety of functionalization strategies. Finally, organic electronic materials can be integrated with a variety of mechanical supports, giving rise to devices with form factors that enable integration with biological systems. While these developments are innovative and promising, it is important to note that the field is still in its infancy, with many unknowns and immense scope for exploration and highly collaborative research. The first part of this Account details the unique properties that render conjugated polymers excellent biointerfacing materials. We then offer an overview of the most common conjugated polymers that have been used as active layers in various organic bioelectronics devices, highlighting the importance of developing new materials. These materials are the most popular ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives as well as conjugated polyelectrolytes and ion-free organic semiconductors functionalized for the biological interface. We then discuss several applications and operation principles of state-of-the-art bioelectronics devices. These devices include electrodes applied to sense/trigger electrophysiological activity of cells as well as electrolyte-gated field-effect and electrochemical transistors used for sensing of biochemical markers. Another prime application example of conjugated polymers is cell actuators. External modulation of the redox state of the underlying conjugated polymer films controls the adhesion behavior and viability of cells. These smart surfaces can be also designed in the form of three-dimensional architectures because of the processability of conjugated polymers. As such, cell-loaded scaffolds based on electroactive polymers enable integrated sensing or stimulation within the engineered tissue itself. A last application example is organic neuromorphic devices, an alternative computing architecture that takes inspiration from biology and, in particular, from the way the brain works. Leveraging ion redistribution inside a conjugated polymer upon application of an electrical field and its coupling with electronic charges, conjugated polymers can be engineered to act as artificial neurons or synapses with complex, history-dependent behavior. We conclude this Account by highlighting main factors that need to be considered for the design of a conjugated polymer for applications in bioelectronics-although there can be various figures of merit given the broad range of applications, as emphasized in this Account.","Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) is a rare disorder caused by the deficient production, secretion or action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is the master hormone regulating the reproductive axis. CHH is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with >25 different causal genes identified to date. Clinically, the disorder is characterized by an absence of puberty and infertility. The association of CHH with a defective sense of smell (anosmia or hyposmia), which is found in ∼50% of patients with CHH is termed Kallmann syndrome and results from incomplete embryonic migration of GnRH-synthesizing neurons. CHH can be challenging to diagnose, particularly when attempting to differentiate it from constitutional delay of puberty. A timely diagnosis and treatment to induce puberty can be beneficial for sexual, bone and metabolic health, and might help minimize some of the psychological effects of CHH. In most cases, fertility can be induced using specialized treatment regimens and several predictors of outcome have been identified. Patients typically require lifelong treatment, yet ∼10–20% of patients exhibit a spontaneous recovery of reproductive function. This Consensus Statement summarizes approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of CHH and discusses important unanswered questions in the field.","The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has become one of the cornerstones of neuropathology, influencing synaptic plasticity, cognitive resilience, and neuronal survival. Apart from its molecular biology, BDNF is a powerful target for transformative benefit in precision medicine, leading to innovative therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Nevertheless, clinical applicability is obstructed by hurdles in delivery, patient-specific diversity, and pleiotropic signaling. Here, we summarize findings in BDNF research, including its regulatory pathways and diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and integrative therapeutic approaches. We describe innovative delivery systems, such as lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA therapies and CRISPR-dCas9-based epigenetic editing that bypass obstacles such as BBB (blood–brain barrier) and enzymatic degradation. The recent implementation of multiplex panels combining BDNF biodynamic indicators with tau and amyloid-β signaling markers showcases novel levels of specificity for both early detection and potential therapeutic monitoring. Humanized preclinical models like iPSC-derived neurons and organoids point to the key role of BDNF in neurodeveloping and neurodegenerative processes, paralleling advances in bridging preclinical observation and clinical environments. Moreover, novel therapeutic tools delivering TrkB activators or the implementation of AI-based dynamic care platforms enable tailored and scalable treatments. This review also aims to extend a framework used in the understanding of BDNF’s relevance to traditional neurodegenerative models by situating more recent work detailing BDNF’s actions in ischemic tissues and the gut–brain axis in the context of systemic health. Finally, we outline a roadmap for the incorporation of BDNF-centered therapies into worldwide healthcare, highlighting ethical issues, equity, and interdisciplinary decomposition. The therapeutic potential of BDNF heralds a new era in neuroscience and medicine, revolutionizing brain health and paving the way for the advancement of precision medicine.",16.6377920996528,Vector-Borne Disease Control

We used three-dimensional electron microscopy of mouse, macaque, and human cortical samples to study their cell type composition and synaptic circuit architecture. The 2.5-fold increase in interneurons in humans compared with mice was compensated by a change in axonal connection probabilities and therefore did not yield a commensurate increase in inhibitory-versus-excitatory synaptic input balance on human pyramidal cells. Rather, increased inhibition created an expanded interneuron-to-interneuron network, driven by an expansion of interneuron-targeting interneuron types and an increase in their synaptic selectivity for interneuron innervation. These constitute key neuronal network alterations in the human cortex. Description The difference between human and mouse Over the past few decades, the mouse has become a model organism for brain research. Because of the close evolutionary similarity of ion channels, synaptic receptors, and other key molecular constituents of the brain to that of humans, corresponding similarity has been assumed for cortical neuronal circuits. However, comparative synaptic-resolution connectomic studies are required to determine the degree to which circuit structure has evolved between species. Using three-dimensional electron microscopy, Loomba et al. compared mouse and human/macaque cortex synaptic connectivity. Although human cells are much larger compared with mouse neurons and are more numerous, on average, they do not receive more synapses. And, even though there are three times more interneurons in the human cortex than in the mouse, the excitation-to-inhibition ratio is similar between the species. —PRS Three-dimensional electron microscopy of mouse, macaque, and human brain samples elucidates cell type composition and synaptic circuit architecture. INTRODUCTION The analysis of the human brain is a central goal of neuroscience, but for methodological reasons, research has focused on model organisms, the mouse in particular. Because substantial homology was found at the level of ion channels, transcriptional programs, and basic neuronal types, a strong similarity of neuronal circuits across species has also been assumed. However, a rigorous test of the configuration of local neuronal circuitry in mouse versus human—in particular, in the gray matter of the cerebral cortex—is missing. The about 1000-fold increase in number of neurons is the most obvious evolutionary change of neuronal network properties from mouse to human. Whether the structure of the local cortical circuitry has changed as well is, however, unclear. Recent data from transcriptomic analyses has indicated an increase in the proportion of inhibitory interneurons from mouse to human. But what the effect of such a change is on the circuit configurations found in the human cerebral cortex is not known. This is, however, of particular interest also to the study of neuropsychiatric disorders because in these, the alteration of inhibitory-to-excitatory synaptic balance has been identified as one possible mechanistic underpinning. RATIONALE We used recent methodological improvements in connectomics to acquire data from one macaque and two human individuals, using biopsies of the temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex. Human tissue was obtained from neurosurgical interventions related to tumor removal, in which access path tissue was harvested that was not primarily affected by the underlying disease. A key concern in the analysis of human patient tissue has been the relation to epilepsy surgery, when the underlying disease has required often year-long treatment with pharmaceuticals, plausibly altering synaptic connectivity. Therefore, the analysis of nonepileptic surgery tissue seemed of particular importance. We also included data from one macaque individual, who was not known to have any brain-related pathology. RESULTS We acquired three-dimensional electron microscopy data from temporal and frontal cortex of human and temporal and parietal cortex of macaque. From these, we obtained connectomic reconstructions and compared these with five connectomes from mouse cortex. On the basis of these data, we were able to determine the effect of the about 2.5-fold expansion of the interneuron pool in macaque and human cortex compared with that of mouse. Contrary to expectation, the inhibitory-to-excitatory synaptic balance on pyramidal neurons in macaque and human cortex was not substantially altered. Rather, the interneuron pool was selectively expanded for bipolar-type interneurons, which prefer the innervation of other interneurons, and which further increased their preference for interneuron innervation from mouse to human. These changes were each multifold, yielding in effect an about 10-fold expanded interneuron-to-interneuron network in the human cortex that is only sparsely present in mouse. The total amount of synaptic input to pyramidal neurons, however, did not change according to the threefold thickening of the cortex; rather, a modest increase from about 12,000 synaptic inputs in mouse to about 15,000 in human was found. CONCLUSION The principal cells of the cerebral cortex, pyramidal neurons, maintain almost constant inhibitory-to-excitatory input balance and total synaptic input across 100 million years of evolutionary divergence, which is particularly noteworthy with the concomitant 1000-fold expansion of the neuronal network size and the 2.5-fold increase of inhibitory interneurons from mouse to human. Rather, the key network change from mouse to human is an expansion of almost an order of magnitude of an interneuron-to-interneuron network that is virtually absent in mouse but constitutes a substantial part of the human cortical network. Whether this new network is primarily created through the expansion of existing neuronal types, or is related to the creation of new interneuron subtypes, requires further study. The discovery of this network component in human cortex encourages detailed analysis of its function in health and disease.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is closely associated with the efficacy of antidepressants. Chronic treatment with corticosterone (CORT), a well-validated pharmacological stressor, induces depressive-like behaviors and suppresses AHN in experimental animals. However, the possible mechanisms of chronic CORT action remain elusive. Methods: A chronic CORT treatment (0.1 mg/mL, drinking water for 4 weeks) was applied to prepare a mouse model of depression. Immunofluorescence was performed to analyze the hippocampal neurogenesis lineage, and immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a pH-sensitive tandemly tagged light chain 3 (LC3) protein were used to analyze neuronal autophagy. AAV-hSyn-miR30-shRNA was used to knock down autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) expression in the neurons. Results: Chronic CORT induces depressive-like behaviors and decreases the expression of neuronal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus in mice. Moreover, it markedly diminishes the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs), neural progenitor cells, and neuroblasts and impairs the survival and migration of newborn immature and mature neurons in the DG, which may be attributed to changes in the cell cycle kinetics and induction of NSCs apoptosis. Furthermore, chronic CORT induces hyperactive neuronal autophagy in the DG, possibly by increasing the expression of ATG5 and causing excess lysosomal degradation of BDNF in neurons. Notably, inhibiting hyperactive neuronal autophagy in the DG of mice by knocking down Atg5 in neurons using RNA interference reverses the decrease of neuronal BDNF expression, rescues AHN, and exerts antidepressant effects. Conclusion: Our findings reveal a neuronal autophagy-dependent mechanism that links chronic CORT to reduced neuronal BDNF levels, AHN suppression and depressive-like behavior in mice. In addition, our results provide insights for treating depression by targeting neuronal autophagy in the DG of the hippocampus.","A better understanding of proteostasis in health and disease requires robust methods to determine protein half-lives. Here we improve the precision and accuracy of peptide ion intensity-based quantification, enabling more accurate protein turnover determination in non-dividing cells by dynamic SILAC-based proteomics. This approach allows exact determination of protein half-lives ranging from 10 to >1000 h. We identified 4000–6000 proteins in several non-dividing cell types, corresponding to 9699 unique protein identifications over the entire data set. We observed similar protein half-lives in B-cells, natural killer cells and monocytes, whereas hepatocytes and mouse embryonic neurons show substantial differences. Our data set extends and statistically validates the previous observation that subunits of protein complexes tend to have coherent turnover. Moreover, analysis of different proteasome and nuclear pore complex assemblies suggests that their turnover rate is architecture dependent. These results illustrate that our approach allows investigating protein turnover and its implications in various cell types. The proteome-wide characterization of proteostasis depends on robust approaches to determine protein half-lives. Here, the authors improve the accuracy and precision of mass spectrometry-based quantification, enabling reliable protein half-life determination in several non-dividing cell types.","The human brain directs a wide range of complex behaviors ranging from fine motor skills to abstract intelligence and emotion. However, the diversity of cell types that support these skills has not been fully described. Here we used high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing to systematically survey cells across the entire adult human brain in three postmortem donors. We sampled over three million nuclei from approximately 100 dissections across the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Our analysis identified 461 clusters and 3313 subclusters organized largely according to developmental origins. We found area-specific cortical neurons, as well as an unexpectedly high diversity of midbrain and hindbrain neurons. Astrocytes also exhibited regional diversity at multiple scales, comprising subtypes specific to the telencephalon and to more precise anatomical locations. Oligodendrocyte precursors comprised two distinct major types specific to the telencephalon and to the rest of the brain. Together, these findings demonstrate the unique cellular composition of the telencephalon with respect to all major brain cell types. As the first single-cell transcriptomic census of the entire human brain, we provide a resource for understanding the molecular diversity of the human brain in health and disease.","Metformin, a biguanide drug commonly used to treat type-2 diabetes, has been noted to extend healthspan of nondiabetic mice, but this outcome, and the molecular mechanisms that underlie it, have received relatively little experimental attention. To develop a genetic model for study of biguanide effects on healthspan, we investigated metformin impact on aging Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that metformin increases nematode healthspan, slowing lipofuscin accumulation, extending median lifespan, and prolonging youthful locomotory ability in a dose-dependent manner. Genetic data suggest that metformin acts through a mechanism similar to that operative in eating-impaired dietary restriction (DR) mutants, but independent of the insulin signaling pathway. Energy sensor AMPK and AMPK-activating kinase LKB1, which are activated in mammals by metformin treatment, are essential for health benefits in C. elegans, suggesting that metformin engages a metabolic loop conserved across phyla. We also show that the conserved oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2 is essential for metformin healthspan benefits in C. elegans, a mechanistic requirement not previously described in mammals. skn-1, which functions in nematode sensory neurons to promote DR longevity benefits and in intestines for oxidative stress resistance lifespan benefits, must be expressed in both neurons and intestines for metformin-promoted healthspan extension, supporting that metformin improves healthy middle-life aging by activating both DR and antioxidant defense longevity pathways. In addition to defining molecular players operative in metformin healthspan benefits, our data suggest that metformin may be a plausible pharmacological intervention to promote healthy human aging.","The peripheral nervous system (PNS) orchestrates organ function in health and disease. Most cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), are infiltrated by PNS neurons, and this contributes to the complex tumour microenvironment (TME)1,2. However, neuronal cell bodies reside in various PNS ganglia, far from the tumour mass. Thus, cancer-innervating or healthy-organ-innervating neurons are lacking in current tissue-sequencing datasets. To molecularly characterize pancreas- and PDAC-innervating neurons at single-cell resolution, we developed Trace-n-Seq. This method uses retrograde tracing of axons from tissues to their respective ganglia, followed by single-cell isolation and transcriptomic analysis. By characterizing more than 5,000 individual sympathetic and sensory neurons, with about 4,000 innervating PDAC or healthy pancreas, we reveal novel neuronal cell types and molecular networks that are distinct to the pancreas, pancreatitis, PDAC or melanoma metastasis. We integrate single-cell datasets of innervating neurons and the TME to establish a neuron–cancer–microenvironment interactome, delineate cancer-driven neuronal reprogramming and generate a pancreatic-cancer nerve signature. Pharmacological denervation induces a pro-inflammatory TME and increases the effectiveness of immune-checkpoint inhibitors. The taxane nab-paclitaxel causes intratumoral neuropathy, which attenuates PDAC growth and, in combination with sympathetic denervation, results in synergistic tumour regression. Our multi-dimensional data provide insights into the networks and functions of PDAC-innervating neurons, and support the inclusion of denervation in future therapies. A technique that combines retrograde axon tracing with single-cell transcriptomics is used to characterize neurons innervating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and healthy pancreas, providing insight into the role of neural connections in cancer progression.","Age-related neurodegenerative diseases involving amyloid aggregation remain one of the biggest challenges of modern medicine. Alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiome play an active role in the aetiology of neurological disorders. Here, we dissect the amyloidogenic properties of biofilm-associated proteins (BAPs) of the gut microbiota and their implications for synucleinopathies. We demonstrate that BAPs are naturally assembled as amyloid-like fibrils in insoluble fractions isolated from the human gut microbiota. We show that BAP genes are part of the accessory genomes, revealing microbiome variability. Remarkably, the abundance of certain BAP genes in the gut microbiome is correlated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) incidence. Using cultured dopaminergic neurons and Caenorhabditis elegans models, we report that BAP-derived amyloids induce α-synuclein aggregation. Our results show that the chaperone-mediated autophagy is compromised by BAP amyloids. Indeed, inoculation of BAP fibrils into the brains of wild-type mice promote key pathological features of PD. Therefore, our findings establish the use of BAP amyloids as potential targets and biomarkers of α-synucleinopathies. The microbiota of the intestinal tract is considered a large biofilm formed by myriads bacteria that have a considerable impact in health and disease. Here, the authors show that biofilm-associated proteins from intestinal microbiota form amyloid-like structures that exacerbate alpha-synuclein pathologies.","Exposure to particulate matter (PM) in the ambient air and its interactions with APOE alleles may contribute to the acceleration of brain aging and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Neurodegenerative effects of particulate air pollutants were examined in a US-wide cohort of older women from the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) and in experimental mouse models. Residing in places with fine PM exceeding EPA standards increased the risks for global cognitive decline and all-cause dementia respectively by 81 and 92%, with stronger adverse effects in APOE ɛ4/4 carriers. Female EFAD transgenic mice (5xFAD+/−/human APOE ɛ3 or ɛ4+/+) with 225 h exposure to urban nanosized PM (nPM) over 15 weeks showed increased cerebral β-amyloid by thioflavin S for fibrillary amyloid and by immunocytochemistry for Aβ deposits, both exacerbated by APOE ɛ4. Moreover, nPM exposure increased Aβ oligomers, caused selective atrophy of hippocampal CA1 neurites, and decreased the glutamate GluR1 subunit. Wildtype C57BL/6 female mice also showed nPM-induced CA1 atrophy and GluR1 decrease. In vitro nPM exposure of neuroblastoma cells (N2a-APP/swe) increased the pro-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We suggest that airborne PM exposure promotes pathological brain aging in older women, with potentially a greater impact in ɛ4 carriers. The underlying mechanisms may involve increased cerebral Aβ production and selective changes in hippocampal CA1 neurons and glutamate receptor subunits.","Recognition of injured mitochondria for degradation by macroautophagy is essential for cellular health, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Cardiolipin is an inner mitochondrial membrane phospholipid. We found that rotenone, staurosporine, 6-hydroxydopamine and other pro-mitophagy stimuli caused externalization of cardiolipin to the mitochondrial surface in primary cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y cells. RNAi knockdown of cardiolipin synthase or of phospholipid scramblase-3, which transports cardiolipin to the outer mitochondrial membrane, decreased the delivery of mitochondria to autophagosomes. Furthermore, we found that the autophagy protein microtubule-associated-protein-1 light chain 3 (LC3), which mediates both autophagosome formation and cargo recognition, contains cardiolipin-binding sites important for the engulfment of mitochondria by the autophagic system. Mutation of LC3 residues predicted as cardiolipin-interaction sites by computational modelling inhibited its participation in mitophagy. These data indicate that redistribution of cardiolipin serves as an ‘eat-me’ signal for the elimination of damaged mitochondria from neuronal cells.","Multicellular organisms have co-evolved with complex consortia of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, collectively referred to as the microbiota1. In mammals, changes in the composition of the microbiota can influence many physiologic processes (including development, metabolism and immune cell function) and are associated with susceptibility to multiple diseases2. Alterations in the microbiota can also modulate host behaviours—such as social activity, stress, and anxiety-related responses—that are linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders3. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota influence neuronal activity and host behaviour remain poorly defined. Here we show that manipulation of the microbiota in antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the microbiota in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, selective re-establishment of the microbiota revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which microbiota-derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Finally, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and mouse models, suggesting that microbiota-derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behaviour. Together, these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires microbiota-derived signals both during early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice, with implications for our understanding of how diet, infection, and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. A diverse intestinal microbiota is required for mice to undergo extinction-related neuronal plasticity and normal fear extinction learning.",17.6251124393536,Autoimmune Disease Treatment Innovations

Here, we report astrocyte molecular profiles, diversity, and morphology across the mouse central nervous system (CNS). We identified shared and region-specific astrocytic genes and functions and explored the cellular origins of their regional diversity. We identified gene networks correlated with astrocyte morphology, several of which unexpectedly contained Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk genes. CRISPR/Cas9–mediated reduction of candidate genes reduced astrocyte morphological complexity and resulted in cognitive deficits. The same genes were down-regulated in human AD, in an AD mouse model that displayed reduced astrocyte morphology, and in other human brain disorders. We thus provide comprehensive molecular data on astrocyte diversity and mechanisms across the CNS and on the molecular basis of astrocyte morphology in health and disease. Description Astrocyte diversity and morphology Astrocytes are the major type of glia, displaying complex bushy morphologies as their defining feature. Endo et al. studied astrocyte similarities, diversity, and morphology across the mouse central nervous system (CNS) (see the Perspective by Baldwin). They identified gene networks related to astrocyte morphology between CNS regions, several of which unexpectedly included genes related to risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). When expression of these genes was reduced in mice, astrocyte morphological complexity was diminished, and mice exhibited impairments in a cognitive test. Remarkably, the same genes are down-regulated in both a mouse model of AD and in human AD and several other CNS disorders. These findings suggest that loss of astrocyte morphology may be therapeutically targetable in diverse CNS disorders. —SMH The molecular basis of astrocyte diversity and of their complex morphology in health and disease states is elucidated. INTRODUCTION The central nervous system (CNS) comprises a large population of non-neuronal cells called glia. The predominant type of glia are astrocytes, which were discovered ~140 years ago. Astrocytes tile the entire CNS, serve critical homeostatic functions, and display complex, “bushy” morphologies—their defining feature. Unlike CNS neurons, which are highly diverse, astrocytes have historically been considered largely homogenous, serving as a type of omnipresent glue that is equivalent between CNS areas. Although recent studies have challenged this belief, there has been no broad assessment of astrocyte diversity, similarity, or morphology across the CNS of any species. An important goal, therefore, is to rigorously understand the molecular similarities and differences between astrocytes in the CNS, to determine how they affect astrocyte morphology, and to determine how these properties relate to normal and disease conditions. RATIONALE It is critical to understand all cell types of the CNS in detail as part of our quest to explore fundamental biology and to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat CNS disorders. We studied astrocyte regional diversity and major signaling pathways using whole-brain imaging, astrocyte-neuron density, marker expression, astrocyte-specific and bulk tissue gene expression, single-cell gene expression, astrocyte morphology, and interrelationships between gene expression and morphology using bioinformatic methods across the CNS. The data were mined to identify genes and pathways related to astrocyte morphological complexity, which we explored experimentally using gene knockdowns. We then compared these morphology-related genes with astrocytic differentially expressed genes from an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse model displaying reduced astrocyte morphology, as well as in relation to gene expression in AD and other CNS disorders. RESULTS We found several hundred genes that were enriched within and shared among astrocytes in the CNS, with functions related to metabolism, cholesterol, and neurotransmitter uptake and biosynthesis. These genes represent the core functions of astrocytes, but little is known about approximately a third of them, implying that understanding the fundamental physiology of astrocytes across CNS areas is an important ongoing experimental goal. Our data also reveal that astrocytes have molecular features and functions specific to CNS regions, and that these region-specific functions arise from the local tissue environment and by variable representation of seven distinct astrocyte subclusters. We mined our data to identify gene networks related to astrocyte morphology, and unexpectedly discovered several AD risk genes. We developed astrocyte-specific CRISPR/Cas9–based gene knockdown to reduce the expression of such genes in the hippocampus. We found a reduction of astrocyte morphology with changes in a cognitive task after knockdown of key morphology-related genes, indicating that astrocyte morphological changes affect neural circuit function. In addition to AD risk genes that were astrocyte morphology related, we found a significant association between morphology-related genes and those related to several other common CNS disorders. CONCLUSION We provide comprehensive molecular data that will allow many new types of experiments to explore core features of astrocytes across the CNS, in particular, those unique to specific regions and how they relate to the dynamics and biophysics of neural circuits in specific CNS regions. We used our data to identify the molecular underpinnings of astrocyte morphology between CNS regions and to show that reduced astrocyte morphological complexity, and the attendant loss of tissue support, is common to diverse CNS disorders. This raises the prospect that restoring astrocyte morphology, and thus the ensuing neuronal and tissue support functions, may be therapeutically beneficial in disease. Our findings provide the molecular basis to explore such strategies and to unravel the nascent underlying biology determining how astrocytes contribute to CNS function and dysfunction. Astrocyte diversity and morphology across the CNS. (1) Astrocyte morphology and gene expression was measured across CNS regions. (2) Gene expression data revealed the molecular signatures of astrocyte diversity and its origins. (3) Gene expression and morphological data identified gene networks related to complex morphology. Causal roles were explored. (4) Several astrocyte morphology genes were Alzheimer’s disease risk genes, a disorder in which astrocytes displayed reduced morphology.","Glia constitute roughly half of the cells of the central nervous system (CNS) but were long-considered to be static bystanders to its formation and function. Here we provide an overview of how the diverse and dynamic functions of glial cells orchestrate essentially all aspects of nervous system formation and function. Radial glia, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and microglia each influence nervous system development, from neuronal birth, migration, axon specification, and growth through circuit assembly and synaptogenesis. As neural circuits mature, distinct glia fulfill key roles in synaptic communication, plasticity, homeostasis, and network-level activity through dynamic monitoring and alteration of CNS structure and function. Continued elucidation of glial cell biology, and the dynamic interactions of neurons and glia, will enrich our understanding of nervous system formation, health, and function.","Microglia are mononuclear phagocytes of mesodermal origin that migrate to the central nervous system (CNS) during the early stages of embryonic development. After colonizing the CNS, they proliferate and remain able to self-renew throughout life, maintaining the number of microglia around 5-12% of the cells in the CNS parenchyma. They are considered to play key roles in development, homeostasis and innate immunity of the CNS. Microglia are exceptionally diverse in their morphological characteristics, actively modifying the shape of their processes and soma in response to different stimuli. This broad morphological spectrum of microglia responses is considered to be closely correlated to their diverse range of functions in health and disease. However, the morphophysiological attributes of microglia, and the structural and functional features of microglia-neuron interactions, remain largely unknown. Here, we assess the current knowledge of the diverse microglial morphologies, with a focus on the correlation between microglial shape and function. We also outline some of the current challenges, opportunities, and future directions that will help us to tackle unanswered questions about microglia, and to continue unravelling the mysteries of microglia, in all its shapes.","Ocular light exposure has important influences on human health and well-being through modulation of circadian rhythms and sleep, as well as neuroendocrine and cognitive functions. Prevailing patterns of light exposure do not optimally engage these actions for many individuals, but advances in our understanding of the underpinning mechanisms and emerging lighting technologies now present opportunities to adjust lighting to promote optimal physical and mental health and performance. A newly developed, international standard provides a SI-compliant way of quantifying the influence of light on the intrinsically photosensitive, melanopsin-expressing, retinal neurons that mediate these effects. The present report provides recommendations for lighting, based on an expert scientific consensus and expressed in an easily measured quantity (melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance (melaponic EDI)) defined within this standard. The recommendations are supported by detailed analysis of the sensitivity of human circadian, neuroendocrine, and alerting responses to ocular light and provide a straightforward framework to inform lighting design and practice.","COVID‐19 pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is a public health emergency. COVID‐19 typically exhibits respiratory illness. Unexpectedly, emerging clinical reports indicate that neurological symptoms continue to rise, suggesting detrimental effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 on the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that a Düsseldorf isolate of SARS‐CoV‐2 enters 3D human brain organoids within 2 days of exposure. We identified that SARS‐CoV‐2 preferably targets neurons of brain organoids. Imaging neurons of organoids reveal that SARS‐CoV‐2 exposure is associated with altered distribution of Tau from axons to soma, hyperphosphorylation, and apparent neuronal death. Our studies, therefore, provide initial insights into the potential neurotoxic effect of SARS‐CoV‐2 and emphasize that brain organoids could model CNS pathologies of COVID‐19.","Although the potential contribution of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiome to human health, aging, and disease is becoming increasingly acknowledged, the molecular mechanics and signaling pathways of just how this is accomplished is not well-understood. Major bacterial species of the GI tract, such as the abundant Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), secrete a remarkably complex array of pro-inflammatory neurotoxins which, when released from the confines of the healthy GI tract, are pathogenic and highly detrimental to the homeostatic function of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). For the first time here we report the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in brain lysates from the hippocampus and superior temporal lobe neocortex of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Mean LPS levels varied from two-fold increases in the neocortex to three-fold increases in the hippocampus, AD over age-matched controls, however some samples from advanced AD hippocampal cases exhibited up to a 26-fold increase in LPS over age-matched controls. This “Perspectives” paper will further highlight some very recent research on GI tract microbiome signaling to the human CNS, and will update current findings that implicate GI tract microbiome-derived LPS as an important internal contributor to inflammatory degeneration in the CNS.","Classically, the following three morphological states of microglia have been defined: ramified, amoeboid and phagocytic. While ramified cells were long regarded as “resting”, amoeboid and phagocytic microglia were viewed as “activated”. In aged human brains, a fourth, morphologically novel state has been described, i.e., dystrophic microglia, which are thought to be senescent cells. Since microglia are not replenished by blood-borne mononuclear cells under physiological circumstances, they seem to have an “expiration date” limiting their capacity to phagocytose and support neurons. Identifying factors that drive microglial aging may thus be helpful to delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent progress in single-cell deep sequencing methods allowed for more refined differentiation and revealed regional-, age- and sex-dependent differences of the microglial population, and a growing number of studies demonstrate various expression profiles defining microglial subpopulations. Given the heterogeneity of pathologic states in the central nervous system, the need for accurately describing microglial morphology and expression patterns becomes increasingly important. Here, we review commonly used microglial markers and their fluctuations in expression in health and disease, with a focus on IBA1 low/negative microglia, which can be found in individuals with liver disease.","The peripheral nervous system (PNS) orchestrates organ function in health and disease. Most cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), are infiltrated by PNS neurons, and this contributes to the complex tumour microenvironment (TME)1,2. However, neuronal cell bodies reside in various PNS ganglia, far from the tumour mass. Thus, cancer-innervating or healthy-organ-innervating neurons are lacking in current tissue-sequencing datasets. To molecularly characterize pancreas- and PDAC-innervating neurons at single-cell resolution, we developed Trace-n-Seq. This method uses retrograde tracing of axons from tissues to their respective ganglia, followed by single-cell isolation and transcriptomic analysis. By characterizing more than 5,000 individual sympathetic and sensory neurons, with about 4,000 innervating PDAC or healthy pancreas, we reveal novel neuronal cell types and molecular networks that are distinct to the pancreas, pancreatitis, PDAC or melanoma metastasis. We integrate single-cell datasets of innervating neurons and the TME to establish a neuron–cancer–microenvironment interactome, delineate cancer-driven neuronal reprogramming and generate a pancreatic-cancer nerve signature. Pharmacological denervation induces a pro-inflammatory TME and increases the effectiveness of immune-checkpoint inhibitors. The taxane nab-paclitaxel causes intratumoral neuropathy, which attenuates PDAC growth and, in combination with sympathetic denervation, results in synergistic tumour regression. Our multi-dimensional data provide insights into the networks and functions of PDAC-innervating neurons, and support the inclusion of denervation in future therapies. A technique that combines retrograde axon tracing with single-cell transcriptomics is used to characterize neurons innervating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and healthy pancreas, providing insight into the role of neural connections in cancer progression.","The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a critical regulator of CNS homeostasis. It possesses physical and biochemical characteristics (i.e. tight junction protein complexes, transporters) that are necessary for the BBB to perform this physiological role. Microvascular endothelial cells require support from astrocytes, pericytes, microglia, neurons, and constituents of the extracellular matrix. This intricate relationship implies the existence of a neurovascular unit (NVU). NVU cellular components can be activated in disease and contribute to dynamic remodeling of the BBB. This is especially true of microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, which polarize into distinct proinflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. Current data indicate that M1 pro-inflammatory microglia contribute to BBB dysfunction and vascular “leak”, while M2 anti-inflammatory microglia play a protective role at the BBB. Understanding biological mechanisms involved in microglia activation provides a unique opportunity to develop novel treatment approaches for neurological diseases. In this review, we highlight characteristics of M1 proinflammatory and M2 anti-inflammatory microglia and describe how these distinct phenotypes modulate BBB physiology. Additionally, we outline the role of other NVU cell types in regulating microglial activation and highlight how microglia can be targeted for treatment of disease with a focus on ischemic stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.","Recognition of injured mitochondria for degradation by macroautophagy is essential for cellular health, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood.
