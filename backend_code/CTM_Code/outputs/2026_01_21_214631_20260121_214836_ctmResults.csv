Its diverse homeostatic roles, particularly in immunology and vascular biology, can go awry in numerous diseases, including multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, and fibrosis. The centrality of S1P signaling has led to the development of several drugs, including two approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis. In a Review, Cartier and Hla discuss the current understanding of how one mediator can carry out so many signaling roles in different tissues, how these become dysregulated in disease, and efforts in drug development to target S1P signaling. Science, this issue p. eaar5551 BACKGROUND Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a product of membrane sphingolipid metabolism, is secreted and acts through G protein–coupled S1P receptors (S1PRs) in vertebrates. S1PR isoforms mediate complex cellular actions either alone or in combination in most organ systems. This stable lysolipid circulates as a complex with protein chaperones that not only enables aqueous solubility but also helps facilitate specific modes of receptor signaling. However, differential concentration gradients of S1P are normally present in various compartments and are perturbed under disease conditions. The abundance of circulatory S1P and the high expression of S1PRs in exposed cells—that is, vascular and hematopoietic cells—poses a key question of how this signaling axis is regulated. This question is of clinical relevance because the first S1PR-targeted drug, fingolimod, has been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis since 2010. Recent findings from basic research as well as insights gleaned from clinical and translational studies have enriched our understanding of how this simple lysolipid evolved as a complex regulator of multiple physiological systems and, when dysregulated, contributes to numerous diseases. ADVANCES Extracellular spatial gradients of S1P, demonstrated by using S1P reporters, are tightly regulated and control fundamental processes such as hematopoietic cell trafficking, immune cell fate, and vascular integrity. The gradients are formed through location-specific function of metabolic enzymes, S1P transporters, and chaperones. Such physiological S1P gradients are altered in diseases, thus contributing to conditions such as inflammation, autoimmunity, and vascular dysfunction. S1P complexed to chaperone proteins—for example, high-density lipoprotein–bound apolipoprotein M—mediate distinct modes of receptor activation, resulting in biased receptor signaling and specific biological outcomes. S1PRs are also regulated tightly through endocytic mechanisms and receptor modulators that enhance or inhibit signal strength and duration. Various signaling mechanisms of this simple lysolipid mediator has helped reveal its multiple actions in the immune system, which include adaptive immune cell localization in various compartments (egress versus retention), fate switching, survival, and activation that influences both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. In the cardiovascular system, high expression of multiple S1PR isoforms in various cell types regulate development, homeostasis, and physiology. Current S1PR-targeted drugs that aim to tame autoimmunity exhibit considerable cardiovascular-adverse events. In the central nervous system (CNS), widespread application of S1PR-targeted drugs in autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases has stimulated research that revealed the broad but poorly understood effects of S1P signaling in neurodevelopment, the neurovascular unit, neurons, and glia. Furthermore, in addition to the involvement of pathological S1P signaling in acute ischemic conditions of various organs, chronic dysregulated S1P signaling has been implicated in fibrotic diseases of lung, heart, liver, and kidney. OUTLOOK Considerable challenges remain to fully harness the new knowledge in S1P pathobiology to translational utility in clinical medicine. Approaches that mimic S1P chaperones, S1P neutralizing agents, modulation of transporters, biased agonists and antagonists of S1PR isotypes, and sphingolipid metabolic enzyme modulators provide viable pathways to therapy. Focusing on the immune system, such approaches may widen the autoimmunity therapeutic landscape and provide new directions in cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. For cardiovascular diseases, ischemic conditions as well as chronic heart failure are likely candidates for future translational efforts. Although further work is needed, S1P-targeted approaches may also be useful in regenerative therapies for the aging and diseased myocardium. The CNS-targeted efforts may cross into neurodegenerative diseases, given the success with S1PR-targeted drugs in reducing brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis. Other potential applications include approaches in pain management and neurodevelopmental disorders. Such strategies, although challenging, are greatly helped by findings from basic research on S1P pathobiology as well as pharmacological and clinical insights derived from the application of S1P-targeted therapeutics. S1PR signaling regulates multiorgan pathophysiological processes. Extracellular S1P gradients created by transporters, chaperones (ApoM+HDL), and metabolic enzymes (LPP3) interact with S1PRs on the cell surface. Receptor activity, transmitted by means of G proteins, is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including β-arrestin coupling, endocytosis, and receptor modulators. The resultant cellular changes influence multiple organ systems in physiology and disease. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a metabolic product of cell membrane sphingolipids, is bound to extracellular chaperones, is enriched in circulatory fluids, and binds to G protein–coupled S1P receptors (S1PRs) to regulate embryonic development, postnatal organ function, and disease. S1PRs regulate essential processes such as adaptive immune cell trafficking, vascular development, and homeostasis. Moreover, S1PR signaling is a driver of multiple diseases. The past decade has witnessed an exponential growth in this field, in part because of multidisciplinary research focused on this lipid mediator and the application of S1PR-targeted drugs in clinical medicine. This has revealed fundamental principles of lysophospholipid mediator signaling that not only clarify the complex and wide ranging actions of S1P but also guide the development of therapeutics and translational directions in immunological, cardiovascular, neurological, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are two typical neurodegenerative diseases that increased with aging. With the emergence of aging population, the health problem and economic burden caused by the two diseases also increase. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway regulates signal transduction and biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism. According to reports, it regulates neurotoxicity and mediates the survival of neurons through different substrates such as forkhead box protein Os (FoxOs), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and caspase-9. Accumulating evidences indicate that some natural products can play a neuroprotective role by activating PI3K/AKT pathway, providing an effective resource for the discovery of potential therapeutic drugs. This article reviews the relationship between AKT signaling pathway and AD and PD, and discusses the potential natural products based on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to treat two diseases in recent years, hoping to provide guidance and reference for this field. Further development of Chinese herbal medicine is needed to treat these two diseases.","Physiological signal processing plays a key role in next-generation human-machine interfaces as physiological signals provide rich cognition- and health-related information. However, the explosion of physiological signal data presents challenges for traditional systems. Here, we propose a highly efficient neuromorphic physiological signal processing system based on VO2 memristors. The volatile and positive/negative symmetric threshold switching characteristics of VO2 memristors are leveraged to construct a sparse-spiking yet high-fidelity asynchronous spike encoder for physiological signals. Besides, the dynamical behavior of VO2 memristors is utilized in compact Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) and Adaptive-LIF (ALIF) neurons, which are incorporated into a decision-making Long short-term memory Spiking Neural Network. The system demonstrates superior computing capabilities, needing only small-sized LSNNs to attain high accuracies of 95.83% and 99.79% in arrhythmia classification and epileptic seizure detection, respectively. This work highlights the potential of memristors in constructing efficient neuromorphic physiological signal processing systems and promoting next-generation human-machine interfaces.","Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by progressive damage to the nervous system including the selective loss of vulnerable populations of neurons leading to motor symptoms and cognitive decline. Despite millions of people being affected worldwide, there are still no drugs that block the neurodegenerative process to stop or slow disease progression. Neuronal death in these diseases is often linked to the misfolded proteins that aggregate within the brain (proteinopathies) as a result of disease-related gene mutations or abnormal protein homoeostasis. There are two major degradation pathways to rid a cell of unwanted or misfolded proteins to prevent their accumulation and to maintain the health of a cell: the ubiquitin–proteasome system and the autophagy–lysosomal pathway. Both of these degradative pathways depend on the modification of targets with ubiquitin. Aging is the primary risk factor of most neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. With aging there is a general reduction in proteasomal degradation and autophagy, and a consequent increase of potentially neurotoxic protein aggregates of β-amyloid, tau, α-synuclein, SOD1 and TDP-43. An often over-looked yet major component of these aggregates is ubiquitin, implicating these protein aggregates as either an adaptive response to toxic misfolded proteins or as evidence of dysregulated ubiquitin-mediated degradation driving toxic aggregation. In addition, non-degradative ubiquitin signalling is critical for homoeostatic mechanisms fundamental for neuronal function and survival, including mitochondrial homoeostasis, receptor trafficking and DNA damage responses, whilst also playing a role in inflammatory processes. This review will discuss the current understanding of the role of ubiquitin-dependent processes in the progressive loss of neurons and the emergence of ubiquitin signalling as a target for the development of much needed new drugs to treat neurodegenerative disease.","Neuropathic pain is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system, including peripheral fibres (Aβ, Aδ and C fibres) and central neurons, and affects 7–10% of the general population. Multiple causes of neuropathic pain have been described and its incidence is likely to increase owing to the ageing global population, increased incidence of diabetes mellitus and improved survival from cancer after chemotherapy. Indeed, imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory somatosensory signalling, alterations in ion channels and variability in the way that pain messages are modulated in the central nervous system all have been implicated in neuropathic pain. The burden of chronic neuropathic pain seems to be related to the complexity of neuropathic symptoms, poor outcomes and difficult treatment decisions. Importantly, quality of life is impaired in patients with neuropathic pain owing to increased drug prescriptions and visits to health care providers, as well as the morbidity from the pain itself and the inciting disease. Despite challenges, progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain is spurring the development of new diagnostic procedures and personalized interventions, which emphasize the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of neuropathic pain.","Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on tau have long been recognized as affecting protein function and contributing to neurodegeneration. The explosion of information on potential and observed PTMs on tau provides an opportunity to better understand these modifications in the context of tau homeostasis, which becomes perturbed with aging and disease. Prevailing views regard tau as a protein that undergoes abnormal phosphorylation prior to its accumulation into the toxic aggregates implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. However, the phosphorylation of tau may, in fact, represent part of the normal but interrupted function and catabolism of the protein. In addition to phosphorylation, tau undergoes another forms of post-translational modification including (but not limited to), acetylation, ubiquitination, glycation, glycosylation, SUMOylation, methylation, oxidation, and nitration. A holistic appreciation of how these PTMs regulate tau during health and are potentially hijacked in disease remains elusive. Recent studies have reinforced the idea that PTMs play a critical role in tau localization, protein-protein interactions, maintenance of levels, and modifying aggregate structure. These studies also provide tantalizing clues into the possibility that neurons actively choose how tau is post-translationally modified, in potentially competitive and combinatorial ways, to achieve broad, cellular programs commensurate with the distinctive environmental conditions found during development, aging, stress, and disease. Here, we review tau PTMs and describe what is currently known about their functional impacts. In addition, we classify these PTMs from the perspectives of protein localization, electrostatics, and stability, which all contribute to normal tau function and homeostasis. Finally, we assess the potential impact of tau PTMs on tau solubility and aggregation. Tau occupies an undoubtedly important position in the biology of neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to provide an integrated perspective of how post-translational modifications actively, purposefully, and dynamically remodel tau function, clearance, and aggregation. In doing so, we hope to enable a more comprehensive understanding of tau PTMs that will positively impact future studies.","The adult quiescent blood–brain barrier (BBB), a structure organised by endothelial cells through interactions with pericytes, astrocytes, neurons and microglia in the neurovascular unit, is highly regulated but fragile at the same time. In the past decade, there has been considerable progress in understanding not only the molecular pathways involved in BBB development, but also BBB breakdown in neurological diseases. Specifically, the Wnt/β-catenin, retinoic acid and sonic hedgehog pathways moved into the focus of BBB research. Moreover, angiopoietin/Tie2 signalling that is linked to angiogenic processes has gained attention in the BBB field. Blood vessels play an essential role in initiation and progression of many diseases, including inflammation outside the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, the potential influence of CNS blood vessels in neurological diseases associated with BBB alterations or neuroinflammation has become a major focus of current research to understand their contribution to pathogenesis. Moreover, the BBB remains a major obstacle to pharmaceutical intervention in the CNS. The complications may either be expressed by inadequate therapeutic delivery like in brain tumours, or by poor delivery of the drug across the BBB and ineffective bioavailability. In this review, we initially describe the cellular and molecular components that contribute to the steady state of the healthy BBB. We then discuss BBB alterations in ischaemic stroke, primary and metastatic brain tumour, chronic inflammation and Alzheimer’s disease. Throughout the review, we highlight common mechanisms of BBB abnormalities among these diseases, in particular the contribution of neuroinflammation to BBB dysfunction and disease progression, and emphasise unique aspects of BBB alteration in certain diseases such as brain tumours. Moreover, this review highlights novel strategies to monitor BBB function by non-invasive imaging techniques focussing on ischaemic stroke, as well as novel ways to modulate BBB permeability and function to promote treatment of brain tumours, inflammation and Alzheimer’s disease. In conclusion, a deep understanding of signals that maintain the healthy BBB and promote fluctuations in BBB permeability in disease states will be key to elucidate disease mechanisms and to identify potential targets for diagnostics and therapeutic modulation of the BBB.","The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has become one of the cornerstones of neuropathology, influencing synaptic plasticity, cognitive resilience, and neuronal survival. Apart from its molecular biology, BDNF is a powerful target for transformative benefit in precision medicine, leading to innovative therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Nevertheless, clinical applicability is obstructed by hurdles in delivery, patient-specific diversity, and pleiotropic signaling. Here, we summarize findings in BDNF research, including its regulatory pathways and diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and integrative therapeutic approaches. We describe innovative delivery systems, such as lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA therapies and CRISPR-dCas9-based epigenetic editing that bypass obstacles such as BBB (blood–brain barrier) and enzymatic degradation. The recent implementation of multiplex panels combining BDNF biodynamic indicators with tau and amyloid-β signaling markers showcases novel levels of specificity for both early detection and potential therapeutic monitoring. Humanized preclinical models like iPSC-derived neurons and organoids point to the key role of BDNF in neurodeveloping and neurodegenerative processes, paralleling advances in bridging preclinical observation and clinical environments. Moreover, novel therapeutic tools delivering TrkB activators or the implementation of AI-based dynamic care platforms enable tailored and scalable treatments. This review also aims to extend a framework used in the understanding of BDNF’s relevance to traditional neurodegenerative models by situating more recent work detailing BDNF’s actions in ischemic tissues and the gut–brain axis in the context of systemic health. Finally, we outline a roadmap for the incorporation of BDNF-centered therapies into worldwide healthcare, highlighting ethical issues, equity, and interdisciplinary decomposition. The therapeutic potential of BDNF heralds a new era in neuroscience and medicine, revolutionizing brain health and paving the way for the advancement of precision medicine.","Age is the main risk factor for a number of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which increasing numbers of elderly individuals suffer. These pathological conditions are characterized by progressive loss of neuron cells, compromised motor or cognitive functions, and accumulation of abnormally aggregated proteins. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the main features of the aging process, particularly in organs requiring a high-energy source such as the heart, muscles, brain, or liver. Neurons rely almost exclusively on the mitochondria, which produce the energy required for most of the cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter synthesis. The brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and damage, because of its high oxygen consumption, low antioxidant defenses, and high content of polyunsaturated fats very prone to be oxidized. Thus, it is not surprising the importance of protecting systems, including antioxidant defenses, to maintain neuronal integrity and survival. Here, we review the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in the aging process, with a specific focus on neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involving mitochondria and oxidative stress in the aging and neurodegeneration may help to identify new strategies for improving the health and extending lifespan.","Polyphenols are found ubiquitously in plants and their regular consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of a number of chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurodegenerative disorders. Rather than exerting direct antioxidant effects, the mechanisms by which polyphenols express these beneficial properties appear to involve their interaction with cellular signaling pathways and related machinery that mediate cell function under both normal and pathological conditions. We illustrate that their interactions with two such pathways, the MAP kinase (ERK, JNK, p38) and PI3 kinase/Akt signaling cascades, allow them to impact upon normal and abnormal cell function, thus influencing the cellular processes involved in the initiation and progression of cancer, CVD and neurodegeneration. For example, their ability to activate ERK in neurons leads to a promotion of neuronal survival and cognitive enhancements, both of which influence the progression of Alzheimer's disease, whilst ERK activation by polyphenols in vascular endothelial cells influences nitric oxide production, blood pressure and ultimately CVD risk. The main focus of this review is to provide an overview of the role that polyphenols play in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. We present epidemiological data, human intervention study findings, as well as animal and in vitro studies in support of these actions and in each case we consider how their actions at the cellular level may underpin their physiological effects.",22.840250369838,Neurodegenerative Disease Research

As the SARS-CoV-2 infection has become pandemic, the scientific community is in a race against time to beat the COVID19 by unraveling molecular targets and discover epitopes in the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 for vaccines/antibodies synthesis. It has been reported that in addition to the conventional respiratory complains of flu, patients are also exhibiting neurological signs and symptoms. Recently, the report of a patient with COVID-19 exhibiting loss of the involuntary process of breathing1 controlled by the inspiratory area in the brainstem, is alarming. Additionally, neurological deficits reported in uncomplicated and complicated patients with COVID-192 from hospitals in Wuhan, China, are convincing enough that the neurological deficits could be ongoing in the recent outbreak without getting noticed. As the recent outbreak has now spread to almost all of the continents and has become pandemic, we are in the early phases of our attempts to understand the syndromic complexity of the COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 can take two pathways to involve the brain (Figure 1). Early occurrences of loss of smell, ataxia, and convulsions should be further evaluated for CNS involvement by SARS-CoV-2. The clinicians throughout the world in general, and Wuhan, China, in particular, are getting the firsthand to study and report the real-time clinical presentations of the patients affected by COVID19. The prognostic and diagnostic significance of neurological sign and symptoms in COVID-19 patients can be gauged by fact that the protocol designed to investigate the First Few X cases (FFX) and their close contacts by the World Health Organization (WHO), includes a separate section for “other neurological signs” in addition to separate columns for respiratory symptoms.3 Additionally, reports of COVID-19-affected individuals experiencing convulsions in prevalent areas is alarming and need to be distinguished from febrile convolution that is expected to occur with high-grade fever in patients with COVID-19. Our experience with taxonomically related SARS-CoV patients in the past has proven beyond doubt the coronaviruses to affect the brain. Of many examples from the past, was a case where SARS-CoV was isolated from the brain of a patient who had exhibited features of neurological deficits on 28th day of infection.4 In past outbreaks with SARS-CoV, it has been shown that it targets the CNS5 and the reports that the brain also is an additional target of SARS-CoV4 raises the possibility of the presentation of more patients with neurological manifestations in the ongoing outbreak of COIVD-19. Also, SARS-CoV has been isolated from brain tissue with edema and neuronal degeneration as seen at autopsies with immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopic confirmation of viral infection of the neurons.6 It would not be surprising to see the COVID-19 virus following the same trend as both viruses are near identical taxonomically. As the pandemic is in effect at present, a detailed timeline of the syndromic neurological manifestation in COVID-19 will emerge as more studies get published on complicated and uncomplicated cases of COVID-19. Though the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the CNS invasion will be revealed in time, there is an urgent need to distinguish between neurologically affected CVOID-19 patients and those who do not exhibit the sign and symptoms of CNS involvement. The hematogenous route appears to be the likely pathway for SARS-CoV-2 to reach the brain, but other routes to the CNS like across the cribriform plate (Figure 1B) of the ethmoid bone in proximity to the olfactory bulb7 should be taken into consideration in cases of early-phase COVID-19-affected patients who exhibit loss of smell and taste accompanied with neurological signs and symptoms. Studies believe that direct SARS-CoV infection of the human CNS does occur in some patients.8 It is also important to mention here that the neurological signs and symptoms observed in the COVID-19 cases could be a manifestation of hypoxia, respiratory, and metabolic acidosis at an advanced stage of the disease, but reasonably, a differential diagnosis of these cases is needed, which could prove lifesaving. The later distinction also appears to be important from the vantage point of selecting a treatment regimen, as management of the COVID-19 cases with neurological involvement would require more specific and aggressive treatments as compared to the patients without it. The significance of a thorough neurological assessment of COVID19 patients cannot be overemphasized which can rule-in or rule out a neurological deficit of a patient admitted after serological tests confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19. Presence of neurological deficits","Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most frequent side effects caused by antineoplastic agents, with a prevalence from 19% to over 85%. Clinically, CIPN is a mostly sensory neuropathy that may be accompanied by motor and autonomic changes of varying intensity and duration. Due to its high prevalence among cancer patients, CIPN constitutes a major problem for both cancer patients and survivors as well as for their health care providers, especially because, at the moment, there is no single effective method of preventing CIPN; moreover, the possibilities of treating this syndrome are very limited. There are six main substance groups that cause damage to peripheral sensory, motor and autonomic neurons, which result in the development of CIPN: platinum-based antineoplastic agents, vinca alkaloids, epothilones (ixabepilone), taxanes, proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib) and immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide). Among them, the most neurotoxic are platinum-based agents, taxanes, ixabepilone and thalidomide; other less neurotoxic but also commonly used drugs are bortezomib and vinca alkaloids. This paper reviews the clinical picture of CIPN and the neurotoxicity mechanisms of the most common antineoplastic agents. A better understanding of the risk factors and underlying mechanisms of CIPN is needed to develop effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.","Our brain serves as a center for cognitive function and neurons within the brain relay and store information about our surroundings and experiences. Modulation of this complex neuronal circuitry allows us to process that information and respond appropriately. Proper development of neurons is therefore vital to the mental health of an individual, and perturbations in their signaling or morphology are likely to result in cognitive impairment. The development of a neuron requires a series of steps that begins with migration from its birth place and initiation of process outgrowth, and ultimately leads to differentiation and the formation of connections that allow it to communicate with appropriate targets. Over the past several years, it has become clear that the Rho family of GTPases and related molecules play an important role in various aspects of neuronal development, including neurite outgrowth and differentiation, axon pathfinding, and dendritic spine formation and maintenance. Given the importance of these molecules in these processes, it is therefore not surprising that mutations in genes encoding a number of regulators and effectors of the Rho GTPases have been associated with human neurological diseases. This review will focus on the role of the Rho GTPases and their associated signaling molecules throughout neuronal development and discuss how perturbations in Rho GTPase signaling may lead to cognitive disorders.","Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) is a rare disorder caused by the deficient production, secretion or action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is the master hormone regulating the reproductive axis. CHH is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with >25 different causal genes identified to date. Clinically, the disorder is characterized by an absence of puberty and infertility. The association of CHH with a defective sense of smell (anosmia or hyposmia), which is found in ∼50% of patients with CHH is termed Kallmann syndrome and results from incomplete embryonic migration of GnRH-synthesizing neurons. CHH can be challenging to diagnose, particularly when attempting to differentiate it from constitutional delay of puberty. A timely diagnosis and treatment to induce puberty can be beneficial for sexual, bone and metabolic health, and might help minimize some of the psychological effects of CHH. In most cases, fertility can be induced using specialized treatment regimens and several predictors of outcome have been identified. Patients typically require lifelong treatment, yet ∼10–20% of patients exhibit a spontaneous recovery of reproductive function. This Consensus Statement summarizes approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of CHH and discusses important unanswered questions in the field.","Ageing is a result of gradual and overall functional deteriorations across the body; however, it is unknown whether an individual tissue primarily works to mediate the ageing progress and control lifespan. Here we show that the hypothalamus is important for the development of whole-body ageing in mice, and that the underlying basis involves hypothalamic immunity mediated by IκB kinase-β (IKK-β), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and related microglia–neuron immune crosstalk. Several interventional models were developed showing that ageing retardation and lifespan extension are achieved in mice by preventing ageing-related hypothalamic or brain IKK-β and NF-κB activation. Mechanistic studies further revealed that IKK-β and NF-κB inhibit gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to mediate ageing-related hypothalamic GnRH decline, and GnRH treatment amends ageing-impaired neurogenesis and decelerates ageing. In conclusion, the hypothalamus has a programmatic role in ageing development via immune–neuroendocrine integration, and immune inhibition or GnRH restoration in the hypothalamus/brain represent two potential strategies for optimizing lifespan and combating ageing-related health problems.","Synaptic homeostasis of the principal neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA is tightly regulated by an intricate metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes known as the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle. In this cycle, astrocytes take up glutamate and GABA from the synapse and convert these neurotransmitters into glutamine. Astrocytic glutamine is subsequently transferred to neurons, serving as the principal precursor for neuronal glutamate and GABA synthesis. The glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle integrates multiple cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release, uptake, synthesis, and metabolism. All of these processes are deeply interdependent and closely coupled to cellular energy metabolism. Astrocytes display highly active mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and several unique metabolic features, including glycogen storage and pyruvate carboxylation, which are essential to sustain continuous glutamine release. However, new roles of oligodendrocytes and microglia in neurotransmitter recycling are emerging. Malfunction of the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle can lead to severe synaptic disruptions and may be implicated in several brain diseases. Here, I review central aspects and recent advances of the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle to highlight how the cycle is functionally connected to critical brain functions and metabolism. First, an overview of glutamate, GABA, and glutamine transport is provided in relation to neurotransmitter recycling. Then, central metabolic aspects of the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle are reviewed, with a special emphasis on the critical metabolic roles of glial cells. Finally, I discuss how aberrant neurotransmitter recycling is linked to neurodegeneration and disease, focusing on astrocyte metabolic dysfunction and brain lipid homeostasis as emerging pathological mechanisms. Instead of viewing the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle as individual biochemical processes, a more holistic and integrative approach is needed to advance our understanding of how neurotransmitter recycling modulates brain function in both health and disease.","Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is highly regulated by a number of environmental and cell-intrinsic factors to adapt to environmental changes. Accumulating evidence suggests that adult-born neurons may play distinct physiological roles in hippocampus-dependent functions, such as memory encoding and mood regulation. In addition, several brain diseases, such as neurological diseases and mood disorders, have deleterious effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and some symptoms of those diseases can be partially explained by the dysregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we review a possible link between the physiological functions of adult-born neurons and their roles in pathological conditions.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder without a cure. Most AD cases are sporadic where age represents the greatest risk factor. Lack of understanding of the disease mechanism hinders the development of efficacious therapeutic approaches. The loss of synapses in the affected brain regions correlates best with cognitive impairment in AD patients and has been considered as the early mechanism that precedes neuronal loss. Oxidative stress has been recognized as a contributing factor in aging and in the progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with age- and disease-dependent loss of mitochondrial function, altered metal homeostasis, and reduced antioxidant defense directly affect synaptic activity and neurotransmission in neurons leading to cognitive dysfunction. In addition, molecular targets affected by ROS include nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, lipids, proteins, calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics and function, cellular architecture, receptor trafficking and endocytosis, and energy homeostasis. Abnormal cellular metabolism in turn could affect the production and accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, which independently could exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production, thereby contributing to a vicious cycle. While mounting evidence implicates ROS in the AD etiology, clinical trials with antioxidant therapies have not produced consistent results. In this review, we will discuss the role of oxidative stress in synaptic dysfunction in AD, innovative therapeutic strategies evolved based on a better understanding of the complexity of molecular mechanisms of AD, and the dual role ROS play in health and disease.","The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a critical regulator of CNS homeostasis. It possesses physical and biochemical characteristics (i.e. tight junction protein complexes, transporters) that are necessary for the BBB to perform this physiological role. Microvascular endothelial cells require support from astrocytes, pericytes, microglia, neurons, and constituents of the extracellular matrix. This intricate relationship implies the existence of a neurovascular unit (NVU). NVU cellular components can be activated in disease and contribute to dynamic remodeling of the BBB. This is especially true of microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, which polarize into distinct proinflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. Current data indicate that M1 pro-inflammatory microglia contribute to BBB dysfunction and vascular “leak”, while M2 anti-inflammatory microglia play a protective role at the BBB. Understanding biological mechanisms involved in microglia activation provides a unique opportunity to develop novel treatment approaches for neurological diseases. In this review, we highlight characteristics of M1 proinflammatory and M2 anti-inflammatory microglia and describe how these distinct phenotypes modulate BBB physiology. Additionally, we outline the role of other NVU cell types in regulating microglial activation and highlight how microglia can be targeted for treatment of disease with a focus on ischemic stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.","The emerging field of organic bioelectronics bridges the electronic world of organic-semiconductor-based devices with the soft, predominantly ionic world of biology. This crosstalk can occur in both directions. For example, a biochemical reaction may change the doping state of an organic material, generating an electronic readout. Conversely, an electronic signal from a device may stimulate a biological event. Cutting-edge research in this field results in the development of a broad variety of meaningful applications, from biosensors and drug delivery systems to health monitoring devices and brain-machine interfaces. Conjugated polymers share similarities in chemical ""nature"" with biological molecules and can be engineered on various forms, including hydrogels that have Young's moduli similar to those of soft tissues and are ionically conducting. The structure of organic materials can be tuned through synthetic chemistry, and their biological properties can be controlled using a variety of functionalization strategies. Finally, organic electronic materials can be integrated with a variety of mechanical supports, giving rise to devices with form factors that enable integration with biological systems. While these developments are innovative and promising, it is important to note that the field is still in its infancy, with many unknowns and immense scope for exploration and highly collaborative research. The first part of this Account details the unique properties that render conjugated polymers excellent biointerfacing materials. We then offer an overview of the most common conjugated polymers that have been used as active layers in various organic bioelectronics devices, highlighting the importance of developing new materials. These materials are the most popular ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives as well as conjugated polyelectrolytes and ion-free organic semiconductors functionalized for the biological interface. We then discuss several applications and operation principles of state-of-the-art bioelectronics devices. These devices include electrodes applied to sense/trigger electrophysiological activity of cells as well as electrolyte-gated field-effect and electrochemical transistors used for sensing of biochemical markers. Another prime application example of conjugated polymers is cell actuators. External modulation of the redox state of the underlying conjugated polymer films controls the adhesion behavior and viability of cells. These smart surfaces can be also designed in the form of three-dimensional architectures because of the processability of conjugated polymers. As such, cell-loaded scaffolds based on electroactive polymers enable integrated sensing or stimulation within the engineered tissue itself. A last application example is organic neuromorphic devices, an alternative computing architecture that takes inspiration from biology and, in particular, from the way the brain works. Leveraging ion redistribution inside a conjugated polymer upon application of an electrical field and its coupling with electronic charges, conjugated polymers can be engineered to act as artificial neurons or synapses with complex, history-dependent behavior. We conclude this Account by highlighting main factors that need to be considered for the design of a conjugated polymer for applications in bioelectronics-although there can be various figures of merit given the broad range of applications, as emphasized in this Account.",21.7647556887856,Personalized Treatment Planning

Here we show that microglia are also critical modulators of neuronal activity and associated behavioural responses in mice. Microglia respond to neuronal activation by suppressing neuronal activity, and ablation of microglia amplifies and synchronizes the activity of neurons, leading to seizures. Suppression of neuronal activation by microglia occurs in a highly region-specific fashion and depends on the ability of microglia to sense and catabolize extracellular ATP, which is released upon neuronal activation by neurons and astrocytes. ATP triggers the recruitment of microglial protrusions and is converted by the microglial ATP/ADP hydrolysing ectoenzyme CD39 into AMP; AMP is then converted into adenosine by CD73, which is expressed on microglia as well as other brain cells. Microglial sensing of ATP, the ensuing microglia-dependent production of adenosine, and the adenosine-mediated suppression of neuronal responses via the adenosine receptor A 1 R are essential for the regulation of neuronal activity and animal behaviour. Our findings suggest that this microglia-driven negative feedback mechanism operates similarly to inhibitory neurons and is essential for protecting the brain from excessive activation in health and disease. Microglia, the brain’s immune cells, suppress neuronal activity in response to synaptic ATP release and alter behavioural responses in mice.","Background: Depression is a mental disorder that poses a serious threat to human health. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is closely associated with the efficacy of antidepressants. Chronic treatment with corticosterone (CORT), a well-validated pharmacological stressor, induces depressive-like behaviors and suppresses AHN in experimental animals. However, the possible mechanisms of chronic CORT action remain elusive. Methods: A chronic CORT treatment (0.1 mg/mL, drinking water for 4 weeks) was applied to prepare a mouse model of depression. Immunofluorescence was performed to analyze the hippocampal neurogenesis lineage, and immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a pH-sensitive tandemly tagged light chain 3 (LC3) protein were used to analyze neuronal autophagy. AAV-hSyn-miR30-shRNA was used to knock down autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) expression in the neurons. Results: Chronic CORT induces depressive-like behaviors and decreases the expression of neuronal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus in mice. Moreover, it markedly diminishes the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs), neural progenitor cells, and neuroblasts and impairs the survival and migration of newborn immature and mature neurons in the DG, which may be attributed to changes in the cell cycle kinetics and induction of NSCs apoptosis. Furthermore, chronic CORT induces hyperactive neuronal autophagy in the DG, possibly by increasing the expression of ATG5 and causing excess lysosomal degradation of BDNF in neurons. Notably, inhibiting hyperactive neuronal autophagy in the DG of mice by knocking down Atg5 in neurons using RNA interference reverses the decrease of neuronal BDNF expression, rescues AHN, and exerts antidepressant effects. Conclusion: Our findings reveal a neuronal autophagy-dependent mechanism that links chronic CORT to reduced neuronal BDNF levels, AHN suppression and depressive-like behavior in mice. In addition, our results provide insights for treating depression by targeting neuronal autophagy in the DG of the hippocampus.","Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with a considerable health and economic burden1. It is characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and a diminished response to symptomatic medical or surgical therapy as the disease progresses2. Cell therapy aims to replenish lost dopaminergic neurons and their striatal projections by intrastriatal grafting. Here, we report the results of an open-label phase I clinical trial (NCT04802733) of an investigational cryopreserved, off-the-shelf dopaminergic neuron progenitor cell product (bemdaneprocel) derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cells and grafted bilaterally into the putamen of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Twelve patients were enrolled sequentially in two cohorts—a low-dose (0.9 million cells, n = 5) and a high-dose (2.7 million cells, n = 7) cohort—and all of the participants received one year of immunosuppression. The trial achieved its primary objectives of safety and tolerability one year after transplantation, with no adverse events related to the cell product. At 18 months after grafting, putaminal 18Fluoro-DOPA positron emission tomography uptake increased, indicating graft survival. Secondary and exploratory clinical outcomes showed improvement or stability, including improvement in the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III OFF scores by an average of 23 points in the high-dose cohort. There were no graft-induced dyskinesias. These data demonstrate safety and support future definitive clinical studies. Bilateral grafts of cryopreserved human embryonic stem cell-derived dopaminergic neuron progenitor cells into the putamen of patients with Parkinson’s disease in a phase I clinical trial showed safety, improvements in off-drug motor function and graft survival at 18 months after transplant.","We report the implantation of patient-derived midbrain dopaminergic progenitor cells, differentiated in vitro from autologous induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in a patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The patient-specific progenitor cells were produced under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions and characterized as having the phenotypic properties of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons; testing in a humanized mouse model (involving peripheral-blood mononuclear cells) indicated an absence of immunogenicity to these cells. The cells were implanted into the putamen (left hemisphere followed by right hemisphere, 6 months apart) of a patient with Parkinson's disease, without the need for immunosuppression. Positron-emission tomography with the use of fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine suggested graft survival. Clinical measures of symptoms of Parkinson's disease after surgery stabilized or improved at 18 to 24 months after implantation.

However, the diversity of cell types that support these skills has not been fully described. Here we used high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing to systematically survey cells across the entire adult human brain in three postmortem donors. We sampled over three million nuclei from approximately 100 dissections across the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Our analysis identified 461 clusters and 3313 subclusters organized largely according to developmental origins. We found area-specific cortical neurons, as well as an unexpectedly high diversity of midbrain and hindbrain neurons. Astrocytes also exhibited regional diversity at multiple scales, comprising subtypes specific to the telencephalon and to more precise anatomical locations. Oligodendrocyte precursors comprised two distinct major types specific to the telencephalon and to the rest of the brain. Together, these findings demonstrate the unique cellular composition of the telencephalon with respect to all major brain cell types. As the first single-cell transcriptomic census of the entire human brain, we provide a resource for understanding the molecular diversity of the human brain in health and disease.","The peripheral nervous system (PNS) orchestrates organ function in health and disease. Most cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), are infiltrated by PNS neurons, and this contributes to the complex tumour microenvironment (TME)1,2. However, neuronal cell bodies reside in various PNS ganglia, far from the tumour mass. Thus, cancer-innervating or healthy-organ-innervating neurons are lacking in current tissue-sequencing datasets. To molecularly characterize pancreas- and PDAC-innervating neurons at single-cell resolution, we developed Trace-n-Seq. This method uses retrograde tracing of axons from tissues to their respective ganglia, followed by single-cell isolation and transcriptomic analysis. By characterizing more than 5,000 individual sympathetic and sensory neurons, with about 4,000 innervating PDAC or healthy pancreas, we reveal novel neuronal cell types and molecular networks that are distinct to the pancreas, pancreatitis, PDAC or melanoma metastasis. We integrate single-cell datasets of innervating neurons and the TME to establish a neuron–cancer–microenvironment interactome, delineate cancer-driven neuronal reprogramming and generate a pancreatic-cancer nerve signature. Pharmacological denervation induces a pro-inflammatory TME and increases the effectiveness of immune-checkpoint inhibitors. The taxane nab-paclitaxel causes intratumoral neuropathy, which attenuates PDAC growth and, in combination with sympathetic denervation, results in synergistic tumour regression. Our multi-dimensional data provide insights into the networks and functions of PDAC-innervating neurons, and support the inclusion of denervation in future therapies. A technique that combines retrograde axon tracing with single-cell transcriptomics is used to characterize neurons innervating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and healthy pancreas, providing insight into the role of neural connections in cancer progression.","Age-related neurodegenerative diseases involving amyloid aggregation remain one of the biggest challenges of modern medicine. Alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiome play an active role in the aetiology of neurological disorders. Here, we dissect the amyloidogenic properties of biofilm-associated proteins (BAPs) of the gut microbiota and their implications for synucleinopathies. We demonstrate that BAPs are naturally assembled as amyloid-like fibrils in insoluble fractions isolated from the human gut microbiota. We show that BAP genes are part of the accessory genomes, revealing microbiome variability. Remarkably, the abundance of certain BAP genes in the gut microbiome is correlated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) incidence. Using cultured dopaminergic neurons and Caenorhabditis elegans models, we report that BAP-derived amyloids induce α-synuclein aggregation. Our results show that the chaperone-mediated autophagy is compromised by BAP amyloids. Indeed, inoculation of BAP fibrils into the brains of wild-type mice promote key pathological features of PD. Therefore, our findings establish the use of BAP amyloids as potential targets and biomarkers of α-synucleinopathies. The microbiota of the intestinal tract is considered a large biofilm formed by myriads bacteria that have a considerable impact in health and disease. Here, the authors show that biofilm-associated proteins from intestinal microbiota form amyloid-like structures that exacerbate alpha-synuclein pathologies.","COVID‐19 pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is a public health emergency. COVID‐19 typically exhibits respiratory illness. Unexpectedly, emerging clinical reports indicate that neurological symptoms continue to rise, suggesting detrimental effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 on the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that a Düsseldorf isolate of SARS‐CoV‐2 enters 3D human brain organoids within 2 days of exposure. We identified that SARS‐CoV‐2 preferably targets neurons of brain organoids. Imaging neurons of organoids reveal that SARS‐CoV‐2 exposure is associated with altered distribution of Tau from axons to soma, hyperphosphorylation, and apparent neuronal death. Our studies, therefore, provide initial insights into the potential neurotoxic effect of SARS‐CoV‐2 and emphasize that brain organoids could model CNS pathologies of COVID‐19.","Multicellular organisms have co-evolved with complex consortia of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, collectively referred to as the microbiota1. In mammals, changes in the composition of the microbiota can influence many physiologic processes (including development, metabolism and immune cell function) and are associated with susceptibility to multiple diseases2. Alterations in the microbiota can also modulate host behaviours—such as social activity, stress, and anxiety-related responses—that are linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders3. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota influence neuronal activity and host behaviour remain poorly defined. Here we show that manipulation of the microbiota in antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the microbiota in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, selective re-establishment of the microbiota revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which microbiota-derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Finally, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and mouse models, suggesting that microbiota-derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behaviour. Together, these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires microbiota-derived signals both during early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice, with implications for our understanding of how diet, infection, and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. A diverse intestinal microbiota is required for mice to undergo extinction-related neuronal plasticity and normal fear extinction learning.","Energy demand of neurons in brain that is covered by glucose supply from the blood is ensured by glucose transporters in capillaries and brain cells. In brain, the facilitative diffusion glucose transporters GLUT1-6 and GLUT8, and the Na+-d-glucose cotransporters SGLT1 are expressed. The glucose transporters mediate uptake of d-glucose across the blood-brain barrier and delivery of d-glucose to astrocytes and neurons. They are critically involved in regulatory adaptations to varying energy demands in response to differing neuronal activities and glucose supply. In this review, a comprehensive overview about verified and proposed roles of cerebral glucose transporters during health and diseases is presented. Our current knowledge is mainly based on experiments performed in rodents. First, the functional properties of human glucose transporters expressed in brain and their cerebral locations are described. Thereafter, proposed physiological functions of GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4, and SGLT1 for energy supply to neurons, glucose sensing, central regulation of glucohomeostasis, and feeding behavior are compiled, and their roles in learning and memory formation are discussed. In addition, diseases are described in which functional changes of cerebral glucose transporters are relevant. These are GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-SD), diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). GLUT1-SD is caused by defect mutations in GLUT1. Diabetes and AD are associated with changed expression of glucose transporters in brain, and transporter-related energy deficiency of neurons may contribute to pathogenesis of AD. Stroke and TBI are associated with changes of glucose transporter expression that influence clinical outcome.",27.0409831489895,AI Clinical Decision Support

Here, we report astrocyte molecular profiles, diversity, and morphology across the mouse central nervous system (CNS). We identified shared and region-specific astrocytic genes and functions and explored the cellular origins of their regional diversity. We identified gene networks correlated with astrocyte morphology, several of which unexpectedly contained Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk genes. CRISPR/Cas9–mediated reduction of candidate genes reduced astrocyte morphological complexity and resulted in cognitive deficits. The same genes were down-regulated in human AD, in an AD mouse model that displayed reduced astrocyte morphology, and in other human brain disorders. We thus provide comprehensive molecular data on astrocyte diversity and mechanisms across the CNS and on the molecular basis of astrocyte morphology in health and disease. Description Astrocyte diversity and morphology Astrocytes are the major type of glia, displaying complex bushy morphologies as their defining feature. Endo et al. studied astrocyte similarities, diversity, and morphology across the mouse central nervous system (CNS) (see the Perspective by Baldwin). They identified gene networks related to astrocyte morphology between CNS regions, several of which unexpectedly included genes related to risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). When expression of these genes was reduced in mice, astrocyte morphological complexity was diminished, and mice exhibited impairments in a cognitive test. Remarkably, the same genes are down-regulated in both a mouse model of AD and in human AD and several other CNS disorders. These findings suggest that loss of astrocyte morphology may be therapeutically targetable in diverse CNS disorders. —SMH The molecular basis of astrocyte diversity and of their complex morphology in health and disease states is elucidated. INTRODUCTION The central nervous system (CNS) comprises a large population of non-neuronal cells called glia. The predominant type of glia are astrocytes, which were discovered ~140 years ago. Astrocytes tile the entire CNS, serve critical homeostatic functions, and display complex, “bushy” morphologies—their defining feature. Unlike CNS neurons, which are highly diverse, astrocytes have historically been considered largely homogenous, serving as a type of omnipresent glue that is equivalent between CNS areas. Although recent studies have challenged this belief, there has been no broad assessment of astrocyte diversity, similarity, or morphology across the CNS of any species. An important goal, therefore, is to rigorously understand the molecular similarities and differences between astrocytes in the CNS, to determine how they affect astrocyte morphology, and to determine how these properties relate to normal and disease conditions. RATIONALE It is critical to understand all cell types of the CNS in detail as part of our quest to explore fundamental biology and to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat CNS disorders. We studied astrocyte regional diversity and major signaling pathways using whole-brain imaging, astrocyte-neuron density, marker expression, astrocyte-specific and bulk tissue gene expression, single-cell gene expression, astrocyte morphology, and interrelationships between gene expression and morphology using bioinformatic methods across the CNS. The data were mined to identify genes and pathways related to astrocyte morphological complexity, which we explored experimentally using gene knockdowns. We then compared these morphology-related genes with astrocytic differentially expressed genes from an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse model displaying reduced astrocyte morphology, as well as in relation to gene expression in AD and other CNS disorders. RESULTS We found several hundred genes that were enriched within and shared among astrocytes in the CNS, with functions related to metabolism, cholesterol, and neurotransmitter uptake and biosynthesis. These genes represent the core functions of astrocytes, but little is known about approximately a third of them, implying that understanding the fundamental physiology of astrocytes across CNS areas is an important ongoing experimental goal. Our data also reveal that astrocytes have molecular features and functions specific to CNS regions, and that these region-specific functions arise from the local tissue environment and by variable representation of seven distinct astrocyte subclusters. We mined our data to identify gene networks related to astrocyte morphology, and unexpectedly discovered several AD risk genes. We developed astrocyte-specific CRISPR/Cas9–based gene knockdown to reduce the expression of such genes in the hippocampus. We found a reduction of astrocyte morphology with changes in a cognitive task after knockdown of key morphology-related genes, indicating that astrocyte morphological changes affect neural circuit function. In addition to AD risk genes that were astrocyte morphology related, we found a significant association between morphology-related genes and those related to several other common CNS disorders. CONCLUSION We provide comprehensive molecular data that will allow many new types of experiments to explore core features of astrocytes across the CNS, in particular, those unique to specific regions and how they relate to the dynamics and biophysics of neural circuits in specific CNS regions. We used our data to identify the molecular underpinnings of astrocyte morphology between CNS regions and to show that reduced astrocyte morphological complexity, and the attendant loss of tissue support, is common to diverse CNS disorders. This raises the prospect that restoring astrocyte morphology, and thus the ensuing neuronal and tissue support functions, may be therapeutically beneficial in disease. Our findings provide the molecular basis to explore such strategies and to unravel the nascent underlying biology determining how astrocytes contribute to CNS function and dysfunction. Astrocyte diversity and morphology across the CNS. (1) Astrocyte morphology and gene expression was measured across CNS regions. (2) Gene expression data revealed the molecular signatures of astrocyte diversity and its origins. (3) Gene expression and morphological data identified gene networks related to complex morphology. Causal roles were explored. (4) Several astrocyte morphology genes were Alzheimer’s disease risk genes, a disorder in which astrocytes displayed reduced morphology.","Glia constitute roughly half of the cells of the central nervous system (CNS) but were long-considered to be static bystanders to its formation and function. Here we provide an overview of how the diverse and dynamic functions of glial cells orchestrate essentially all aspects of nervous system formation and function. Radial glia, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and microglia each influence nervous system development, from neuronal birth, migration, axon specification, and growth through circuit assembly and synaptogenesis. As neural circuits mature, distinct glia fulfill key roles in synaptic communication, plasticity, homeostasis, and network-level activity through dynamic monitoring and alteration of CNS structure and function. Continued elucidation of glial cell biology, and the dynamic interactions of neurons and glia, will enrich our understanding of nervous system formation, health, and function.","Ocular light exposure has important influences on human health and well-being through modulation of circadian rhythms and sleep, as well as neuroendocrine and cognitive functions. Prevailing patterns of light exposure do not optimally engage these actions for many individuals, but advances in our understanding of the underpinning mechanisms and emerging lighting technologies now present opportunities to adjust lighting to promote optimal physical and mental health and performance. A newly developed, international standard provides a SI-compliant way of quantifying the influence of light on the intrinsically photosensitive, melanopsin-expressing, retinal neurons that mediate these effects. The present report provides recommendations for lighting, based on an expert scientific consensus and expressed in an easily measured quantity (melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance (melaponic EDI)) defined within this standard. The recommendations are supported by detailed analysis of the sensitivity of human circadian, neuroendocrine, and alerting responses to ocular light and provide a straightforward framework to inform lighting design and practice.","The peripheral nervous system (PNS) orchestrates organ function in health and disease. Most cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), are infiltrated by PNS neurons, and this contributes to the complex tumour microenvironment (TME)1,2. However, neuronal cell bodies reside in various PNS ganglia, far from the tumour mass. Thus, cancer-innervating or healthy-organ-innervating neurons are lacking in current tissue-sequencing datasets. To molecularly characterize pancreas- and PDAC-innervating neurons at single-cell resolution, we developed Trace-n-Seq. This method uses retrograde tracing of axons from tissues to their respective ganglia, followed by single-cell isolation and transcriptomic analysis. By characterizing more than 5,000 individual sympathetic and sensory neurons, with about 4,000 innervating PDAC or healthy pancreas, we reveal novel neuronal cell types and molecular networks that are distinct to the pancreas, pancreatitis, PDAC or melanoma metastasis. We integrate single-cell datasets of innervating neurons and the TME to establish a neuron–cancer–microenvironment interactome, delineate cancer-driven neuronal reprogramming and generate a pancreatic-cancer nerve signature. Pharmacological denervation induces a pro-inflammatory TME and increases the effectiveness of immune-checkpoint inhibitors. The taxane nab-paclitaxel causes intratumoral neuropathy, which attenuates PDAC growth and, in combination with sympathetic denervation, results in synergistic tumour regression. Our multi-dimensional data provide insights into the networks and functions of PDAC-innervating neurons, and support the inclusion of denervation in future therapies. A technique that combines retrograde axon tracing with single-cell transcriptomics is used to characterize neurons innervating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and healthy pancreas, providing insight into the role of neural connections in cancer progression.","The gut–brain axis represents an important bidirectional communication network, with the vagus nerve acting as a central conduit for peripheral signals from the various gut organs to the central nervous system. Among the molecular mediators involved, serotonin (5-HT), synthesized predominantly by enterochromaffin cells in the gut, plays a pivotal role. Gut-derived serotonin activates vagal afferent fibers, transmitting signals to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and modulating serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) as well as the norepinephrinergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC). This interaction influences emotional regulation, stress responses, and immune modulation. Emerging evidence also highlights the role of microbial metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in enhancing serotonin synthesis and vagal activity, thereby shaping gut–brain communication. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on serotonin signaling, vagal nerve pathways, and central autonomic regulation, with an emphasis on their implications for neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders. By elucidating these pathways, novel therapeutic strategies targeting the gut–brain axis may be developed to improve mental and physical health outcomes.","Microglia are mononuclear phagocytes of mesodermal origin that migrate to the central nervous system (CNS) during the early stages of embryonic development. After colonizing the CNS, they proliferate and remain able to self-renew throughout life, maintaining the number of microglia around 5-12% of the cells in the CNS parenchyma. They are considered to play key roles in development, homeostasis and innate immunity of the CNS. Microglia are exceptionally diverse in their morphological characteristics, actively modifying the shape of their processes and soma in response to different stimuli. This broad morphological spectrum of microglia responses is considered to be closely correlated to their diverse range of functions in health and disease. However, the morphophysiological attributes of microglia, and the structural and functional features of microglia-neuron interactions, remain largely unknown. Here, we assess the current knowledge of the diverse microglial morphologies, with a focus on the correlation between microglial shape and function. We also outline some of the current challenges, opportunities, and future directions that will help us to tackle unanswered questions about microglia, and to continue unravelling the mysteries of microglia, in all its shapes.","COVID‐19 pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is a public health emergency. COVID‐19 typically exhibits respiratory illness. Unexpectedly, emerging clinical reports indicate that neurological symptoms continue to rise, suggesting detrimental effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 on the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that a Düsseldorf isolate of SARS‐CoV‐2 enters 3D human brain organoids within 2 days of exposure. We identified that SARS‐CoV‐2 preferably targets neurons of brain organoids. Imaging neurons of organoids reveal that SARS‐CoV‐2 exposure is associated with altered distribution of Tau from axons to soma, hyperphosphorylation, and apparent neuronal death. Our studies, therefore, provide initial insights into the potential neurotoxic effect of SARS‐CoV‐2 and emphasize that brain organoids could model CNS pathologies of COVID‐19.","M.I.

However, under pathological conditions, aberrant assembly of tau into insoluble aggregates is accompanied by synaptic dysfunction and neural cell death in a range of neurodegenerative disorders, collectively referred to as tauopathies. Recent advances in our understanding of the multiple functions and different locations of tau inside and outside neurons have revealed novel insights into its importance in a diverse range of molecular pathways including cell signalling, synaptic plasticity, and regulation of genomic stability. The present review describes the physiological and pathophysiological properties of tau and how these relate to its distribution and functions in neurons. We highlight the post-translational modifications of tau, which are pivotal in defining and modulating tau localisation and its roles in health and disease. We include discussion of other pathologically relevant changes in tau, including mutation and aggregation, and how these aspects impinge on the propensity of tau to propagate, and potentially drive neuronal loss, in diseased brain. Finally, we describe the cascade of pathological events that may be driven by tau dysfunction, including impaired axonal transport, alterations in synapse and mitochondrial function, activation of the unfolded protein response and defective protein degradation. It is important to fully understand the range of neuronal functions attributed to tau, since this will provide vital information on its involvement in the development and pathogenesis of disease. Such knowledge will enable determination of which critical molecular pathways should be targeted by potential therapeutic agents developed for the treatment of tauopathies.","Background Alzheimer disease (AD) is a major health problem of aging, with tremendous burden on healthcare systems, patients, and families globally. Lecanemab, an FDA-approved amyloid beta (Aβ)-directed antibody indicated for the treatment of early AD, binds with high affinity to soluble Aβ protofibrils, which have been shown to be more toxic to neurons than monomers or insoluble fibrils. Lecanemab has been shown to be well tolerated in multiple clinical trials, although risks include an increased rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions relative to placebo. Methods Clarity AD was an 18-month treatment (Core study), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with open-label extension (OLE) in participants with early AD. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly). Safety evaluations included monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. ARIA occurrence was monitored throughout the study by magnetic resonance imaging, read both locally and centrally. Results Overall, 1795 participants from Core and 1612 participants with at least one dose of lecanemab (Core + OLE) were included. Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in Clarity AD, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the Core study. There were 9 deaths during the OLE, with 4 deemed possibly related to study treatment. Of the 24 deaths in Core + OLE, 3 were due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): 1 placebo in the Core due to ICH, and 2 lecanemab in OLE with concurrent ICH (1 on tissue plasminogen activator and 1 on anticoagulant therapy). In the Core + OLE, the most common adverse events in the lecanemab group (> 10%) were infusion-related reactions (24.5%), ARIA with hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) microhemorrhages (16.0%), COVID-19 (14.7%), ARIA with edema (ARIA-E; 13.6%), and headache (10.3%). ARIA-E and ARIA-H were largely radiographically mild-to-moderate. ARIA-E generally occurred within 3–6 months of treatment, was more common in ApoE e4 carriers (16.8%) and most common in ApoE ε4 homozygous participants (34.5%). Conclusions Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions, ARIA-H, ARIA-E. Clinicians, participants, and caregivers should understand the incidence, monitoring, and management of these events for optimal patient care.

Most AD cases are sporadic where age represents the greatest risk factor. Lack of understanding of the disease mechanism hinders the development of efficacious therapeutic approaches. The loss of synapses in the affected brain regions correlates best with cognitive impairment in AD patients and has been considered as the early mechanism that precedes neuronal loss. Oxidative stress has been recognized as a contributing factor in aging and in the progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with age- and disease-dependent loss of mitochondrial function, altered metal homeostasis, and reduced antioxidant defense directly affect synaptic activity and neurotransmission in neurons leading to cognitive dysfunction. In addition, molecular targets affected by ROS include nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, lipids, proteins, calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics and function, cellular architecture, receptor trafficking and endocytosis, and energy homeostasis. Abnormal cellular metabolism in turn could affect the production and accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, which independently could exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production, thereby contributing to a vicious cycle. While mounting evidence implicates ROS in the AD etiology, clinical trials with antioxidant therapies have not produced consistent results. In this review, we will discuss the role of oxidative stress in synaptic dysfunction in AD, innovative therapeutic strategies evolved based on a better understanding of the complexity of molecular mechanisms of AD, and the dual role ROS play in health and disease.","The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a critical regulator of CNS homeostasis. It possesses physical and biochemical characteristics (i.e. tight junction protein complexes, transporters) that are necessary for the BBB to perform this physiological role. Microvascular endothelial cells require support from astrocytes, pericytes, microglia, neurons, and constituents of the extracellular matrix. This intricate relationship implies the existence of a neurovascular unit (NVU). NVU cellular components can be activated in disease and contribute to dynamic remodeling of the BBB. This is especially true of microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, which polarize into distinct proinflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. Current data indicate that M1 pro-inflammatory microglia contribute to BBB dysfunction and vascular “leak”, while M2 anti-inflammatory microglia play a protective role at the BBB. Understanding biological mechanisms involved in microglia activation provides a unique opportunity to develop novel treatment approaches for neurological diseases. In this review, we highlight characteristics of M1 proinflammatory and M2 anti-inflammatory microglia and describe how these distinct phenotypes modulate BBB physiology. Additionally, we outline the role of other NVU cell types in regulating microglial activation and highlight how microglia can be targeted for treatment of disease with a focus on ischemic stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.","Synaptic homeostasis of the principal neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA is tightly regulated by an intricate metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes known as the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle. In this cycle, astrocytes take up glutamate and GABA from the synapse and convert these neurotransmitters into glutamine. Astrocytic glutamine is subsequently transferred to neurons, serving as the principal precursor for neuronal glutamate and GABA synthesis. The glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle integrates multiple cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release, uptake, synthesis, and metabolism. All of these processes are deeply interdependent and closely coupled to cellular energy metabolism. Astrocytes display highly active mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and several unique metabolic features, including glycogen storage and pyruvate carboxylation, which are essential to sustain continuous glutamine release. However, new roles of oligodendrocytes and microglia in neurotransmitter recycling are emerging. Malfunction of the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle can lead to severe synaptic disruptions and may be implicated in several brain diseases. Here, I review central aspects and recent advances of the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle to highlight how the cycle is functionally connected to critical brain functions and metabolism. First, an overview of glutamate, GABA, and glutamine transport is provided in relation to neurotransmitter recycling. Then, central metabolic aspects of the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle are reviewed, with a special emphasis on the critical metabolic roles of glial cells. Finally, I discuss how aberrant neurotransmitter recycling is linked to neurodegeneration and disease, focusing on astrocyte metabolic dysfunction and brain lipid homeostasis as emerging pathological mechanisms. Instead of viewing the glutamate/GABA‐glutamine cycle as individual biochemical processes, a more holistic and integrative approach is needed to advance our understanding of how neurotransmitter recycling modulates brain function in both health and disease.","Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is highly regulated by a number of environmental and cell-intrinsic factors to adapt to environmental changes. Accumulating evidence suggests that adult-born neurons may play distinct physiological roles in hippocampus-dependent functions, such as memory encoding and mood regulation. In addition, several brain diseases, such as neurological diseases and mood disorders, have deleterious effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and some symptoms of those diseases can be partially explained by the dysregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we review a possible link between the physiological functions of adult-born neurons and their roles in pathological conditions.","Our brain serves as a center for cognitive function and neurons within the brain relay and store information about our surroundings and experiences. Modulation of this complex neuronal circuitry allows us to process that information and respond appropriately. Proper development of neurons is therefore vital to the mental health of an individual, and perturbations in their signaling or morphology are likely to result in cognitive impairment. The development of a neuron requires a series of steps that begins with migration from its birth place and initiation of process outgrowth, and ultimately leads to differentiation and the formation of connections that allow it to communicate with appropriate targets. Over the past several years, it has become clear that the Rho family of GTPases and related molecules play an important role in various aspects of neuronal development, including neurite outgrowth and differentiation, axon pathfinding, and dendritic spine formation and maintenance. Given the importance of these molecules in these processes, it is therefore not surprising that mutations in genes encoding a number of regulators and effectors of the Rho GTPases have been associated with human neurological diseases. This review will focus on the role of the Rho GTPases and their associated signaling molecules throughout neuronal development and discuss how perturbations in Rho GTPase signaling may lead to cognitive disorders.","The emerging field of organic bioelectronics bridges the electronic world of organic-semiconductor-based devices with the soft, predominantly ionic world of biology. This crosstalk can occur in both directions. For example, a biochemical reaction may change the doping state of an organic material, generating an electronic readout. Conversely, an electronic signal from a device may stimulate a biological event. Cutting-edge research in this field results in the development of a broad variety of meaningful applications, from biosensors and drug delivery systems to health monitoring devices and brain-machine interfaces. Conjugated polymers share similarities in chemical ""nature"" with biological molecules and can be engineered on various forms, including hydrogels that have Young's moduli similar to those of soft tissues and are ionically conducting. The structure of organic materials can be tuned through synthetic chemistry, and their biological properties can be controlled using a variety of functionalization strategies. Finally, organic electronic materials can be integrated with a variety of mechanical supports, giving rise to devices with form factors that enable integration with biological systems. While these developments are innovative and promising, it is important to note that the field is still in its infancy, with many unknowns and immense scope for exploration and highly collaborative research. The first part of this Account details the unique properties that render conjugated polymers excellent biointerfacing materials. We then offer an overview of the most common conjugated polymers that have been used as active layers in various organic bioelectronics devices, highlighting the importance of developing new materials. These materials are the most popular ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives as well as conjugated polyelectrolytes and ion-free organic semiconductors functionalized for the biological interface. We then discuss several applications and operation principles of state-of-the-art bioelectronics devices. These devices include electrodes applied to sense/trigger electrophysiological activity of cells as well as electrolyte-gated field-effect and electrochemical transistors used for sensing of biochemical markers. Another prime application example of conjugated polymers is cell actuators. External modulation of the redox state of the underlying conjugated polymer films controls the adhesion behavior and viability of cells. These smart surfaces can be also designed in the form of three-dimensional architectures because of the processability of conjugated polymers. As such, cell-loaded scaffolds based on electroactive polymers enable integrated sensing or stimulation within the engineered tissue itself. A last application example is organic neuromorphic devices, an alternative computing architecture that takes inspiration from biology and, in particular, from the way the brain works. Leveraging ion redistribution inside a conjugated polymer upon application of an electrical field and its coupling with electronic charges, conjugated polymers can be engineered to act as artificial neurons or synapses with complex, history-dependent behavior. We conclude this Account by highlighting main factors that need to be considered for the design of a conjugated polymer for applications in bioelectronics-although there can be various figures of merit given the broad range of applications, as emphasized in this Account.","Ageing is a result of gradual and overall functional deteriorations across the body; however, it is unknown whether an individual tissue primarily works to mediate the ageing progress and control lifespan. Here we show that the hypothalamus is important for the development of whole-body ageing in mice, and that the underlying basis involves hypothalamic immunity mediated by IκB kinase-β (IKK-β), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and related microglia–neuron immune crosstalk. Several interventional models were developed showing that ageing retardation and lifespan extension are achieved in mice by preventing ageing-related hypothalamic or brain IKK-β and NF-κB activation. Mechanistic studies further revealed that IKK-β and NF-κB inhibit gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to mediate ageing-related hypothalamic GnRH decline, and GnRH treatment amends ageing-impaired neurogenesis and decelerates ageing. In conclusion, the hypothalamus has a programmatic role in ageing development via immune–neuroendocrine integration, and immune inhibition or GnRH restoration in the hypothalamus/brain represent two potential strategies for optimizing lifespan and combating ageing-related health problems.","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has turned the world into chaos with its ominously high rate of transmissions. As the SARS-CoV-2 infection has become pandemic, the scientific community is in a race against time to beat the COVID19 by unraveling molecular targets and discover epitopes in the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 for vaccines/antibodies synthesis. It has been reported that in addition to the conventional respiratory complains of flu, patients are also exhibiting neurological signs and symptoms. Recently, the report of a patient with COVID-19 exhibiting loss of the involuntary process of breathing1 controlled by the inspiratory area in the brainstem, is alarming. Additionally, neurological deficits reported in uncomplicated and complicated patients with COVID-192 from hospitals in Wuhan, China, are convincing enough that the neurological deficits could be ongoing in the recent outbreak without getting noticed. As the recent outbreak has now spread to almost all of the continents and has become pandemic, we are in the early phases of our attempts to understand the syndromic complexity of the COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 can take two pathways to involve the brain (Figure 1). Early occurrences of loss of smell, ataxia, and convulsions should be further evaluated for CNS involvement by SARS-CoV-2. The clinicians throughout the world in general, and Wuhan, China, in particular, are getting the firsthand to study and report the real-time clinical presentations of the patients affected by COVID19. The prognostic and diagnostic significance of neurological sign and symptoms in COVID-19 patients can be gauged by fact that the protocol designed to investigate the First Few X cases (FFX) and their close contacts by the World Health Organization (WHO), includes a separate section for “other neurological signs” in addition to separate columns for respiratory symptoms.3 Additionally, reports of COVID-19-affected individuals experiencing convulsions in prevalent areas is alarming and need to be distinguished from febrile convolution that is expected to occur with high-grade fever in patients with COVID-19. Our experience with taxonomically related SARS-CoV patients in the past has proven beyond doubt the coronaviruses to affect the brain. Of many examples from the past, was a case where SARS-CoV was isolated from the brain of a patient who had exhibited features of neurological deficits on 28th day of infection.4 In past outbreaks with SARS-CoV, it has been shown that it targets the CNS5 and the reports that the brain also is an additional target of SARS-CoV4 raises the possibility of the presentation of more patients with neurological manifestations in the ongoing outbreak of COIVD-19. Also, SARS-CoV has been isolated from brain tissue with edema and neuronal degeneration as seen at autopsies with immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopic confirmation of viral infection of the neurons.6 It would not be surprising to see the COVID-19 virus following the same trend as both viruses are near identical taxonomically. As the pandemic is in effect at present, a detailed timeline of the syndromic neurological manifestation in COVID-19 will emerge as more studies get published on complicated and uncomplicated cases of COVID-19. Though the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the CNS invasion will be revealed in time, there is an urgent need to distinguish between neurologically affected CVOID-19 patients and those who do not exhibit the sign and symptoms of CNS involvement. The hematogenous route appears to be the likely pathway for SARS-CoV-2 to reach the brain, but other routes to the CNS like across the cribriform plate (Figure 1B) of the ethmoid bone in proximity to the olfactory bulb7 should be taken into consideration in cases of early-phase COVID-19-affected patients who exhibit loss of smell and taste accompanied with neurological signs and symptoms. Studies believe that direct SARS-CoV infection of the human CNS does occur in some patients.8 It is also important to mention here that the neurological signs and symptoms observed in the COVID-19 cases could be a manifestation of hypoxia, respiratory, and metabolic acidosis at an advanced stage of the disease, but reasonably, a differential diagnosis of these cases is needed, which could prove lifesaving. The later distinction also appears to be important from the vantage point of selecting a treatment regimen, as management of the COVID-19 cases with neurological involvement would require more specific and aggressive treatments as compared to the patients without it. The significance of a thorough neurological assessment of COVID19 patients cannot be overemphasized which can rule-in or rule out a neurological deficit of a patient admitted after serological tests confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19. Presence of neurological deficits","Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) is a rare disorder caused by the deficient production, secretion or action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is the master hormone regulating the reproductive axis. CHH is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with >25 different causal genes identified to date. Clinically, the disorder is characterized by an absence of puberty and infertility. The association of CHH with a defective sense of smell (anosmia or hyposmia), which is found in ∼50% of patients with CHH is termed Kallmann syndrome and results from incomplete embryonic migration of GnRH-synthesizing neurons. CHH can be challenging to diagnose, particularly when attempting to differentiate it from constitutional delay of puberty. A timely diagnosis and treatment to induce puberty can be beneficial for sexual, bone and metabolic health, and might help minimize some of the psychological effects of CHH. In most cases, fertility can be induced using specialized treatment regimens and several predictors of outcome have been identified. Patients typically require lifelong treatment, yet ∼10–20% of patients exhibit a spontaneous recovery of reproductive function. This Consensus Statement summarizes approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of CHH and discusses important unanswered questions in the field.","Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most frequent side effects caused by antineoplastic agents, with a prevalence from 19% to over 85%. Clinically, CIPN is a mostly sensory neuropathy that may be accompanied by motor and autonomic changes of varying intensity and duration. Due to its high prevalence among cancer patients, CIPN constitutes a major problem for both cancer patients and survivors as well as for their health care providers, especially because, at the moment, there is no single effective method of preventing CIPN; moreover, the possibilities of treating this syndrome are very limited. There are six main substance groups that cause damage to peripheral sensory, motor and autonomic neurons, which result in the development of CIPN: platinum-based antineoplastic agents, vinca alkaloids, epothilones (ixabepilone), taxanes, proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib) and immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide). Among them, the most neurotoxic are platinum-based agents, taxanes, ixabepilone and thalidomide; other less neurotoxic but also commonly used drugs are bortezomib and vinca alkaloids. This paper reviews the clinical picture of CIPN and the neurotoxicity mechanisms of the most common antineoplastic agents. A better understanding of the risk factors and underlying mechanisms of CIPN is needed to develop effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.",17.1771373369117,Autoimmune Disease Treatment Innovations
