They have been used by farmers to control weeds and insects, and their remarkable increases in agricultural products have been reported. The increase in the world’s population in the 20th century could not have been possible without a parallel increase in food production. About one-third of agricultural products are produced depending on the application of pesticides. Without the use of pesticides, there would be a 78% loss of fruit production, a 54% loss of vegetable production, and a 32% loss of cereal production. Therefore, pesticides play a critical role in reducing diseases and increasing crop yields worldwide. Thus, it is essential to discuss the agricultural development process; the historical perspective, types and specific uses of pesticides; and pesticide behavior, its contamination, and adverse effects on the natural environment. The review study indicates that agricultural development has a long history in many places around the world. The history of pesticide use can be divided into three periods of time. Pesticides are classified by different classification terms such as chemical classes, functional groups, modes of action, and toxicity. Pesticides are used to kill pests and control weeds using chemical ingredients; hence, they can also be toxic to other organisms, including birds, fish, beneficial insects, and non-target plants, as well as air, water, soil, and crops. Moreover, pesticide contamination moves away from the target plants, resulting in environmental pollution. Such chemical residues impact human health through environmental and food contamination. In addition, climate change-related factors also impact on pesticide application and result in increased pesticide usage and pesticide pollution. Therefore, this review will provide the scientific information necessary for pesticide application and management in the future.",https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/3/1112/pdf?version=1611886950,

Though much conservation has occurred, our natural environment continues to decline under the weight of our consumption. Humanity depends directly on the output of nature; thus, this decline will affect us, just as it does the other species with which we share this world. Díaz et al. review the findings of the largest assessment of the state of nature conducted as of yet. They report that the state of nature, and the state of the equitable distribution of nature's support, is in serious decline. Only immediate transformation of global business-as-usual economies and operations will sustain nature as we know it, and us, into the future. Science, this issue p. eaax3100 BACKGROUND Human actions have long been known to drive declines in nature, and there is growing awareness of how globalization means that these drivers increasingly act at a distance (telecoupling). However, evidence from different disciplines has largely accumulated in parallel, and the global effects of telecouplings have never been addressed comprehensively. Now, the first integrated global-scale intergovernmental assessment of the status, trends, and future of the links between people and nature provides an unprecedented picture of the extent of our mutual dependence, the breadth and depth of the ongoing and impending crisis, and the interconnectedness among sectors and regions. ADVANCES Human impacts on life on Earth have increased sharply since the 1970s. The world is increasingly managed to maximize the flow of material contributions from nature to keep up with rising demands for food, energy, timber, and more, with global trade increasing the geographic separation between supply and demand. This unparalleled appropriation of nature is causing the fabric of life on which humanity depends to fray and unravel: Most indicators of the state of nature, whether monitored by natural and social scientists or by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, are declining. These include the number and population size of wild species, the number of local varieties of domesticated species, the distinctness of ecological communities, and the extent and integrity of many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. As a consequence, nature’s capacity to provide crucial benefits has also declined, including environmental processes underpinning human health and nonmaterial contributions to human quality of life. The costs are distributed unequally, as are the benefits of an expanding global economy. These trends in nature and its contributions to people are projected to worsen in the coming decades—unevenly so among different regions—unless rapid and integrated action is taken to reduce the direct drivers responsible for most change over the past 50 years: land and sea use change, direct harvesting of many plants and animals, climate change (whose impacts are set to accelerate), pollution, and the spread of invasive alien species. Exploratory scenarios suggest that a world with increased regional barriers—resonating with recent geopolitical trends—will yield more negative global trends in nature, as well as the greatest disparity in trends across regions, greater than a world with liberal financial markets, and much greater than one that prioritizes and integrates actions toward sustainable development. Evidence from target-seeking scenarios and pathways indicates that a world that achieves many of the global biodiversity targets and sustainability goals related to food, energy, climate, and water is not—yet—beyond reach, but that no single action can get us there. OUTLOOK Our comprehensive assessment of status, trends, and possible futures for nature and people suggests that action at the level of direct drivers of nature decline, although necessary, is not sufficient to prevent further deterioration of the fabric of life on Earth. Reversal of recent declines—and a sustainable global future—are only possible with urgent transformative change that tackles the root causes: the interconnected economic, sociocultural, demographic, political, institutional, and technological indirect drivers behind the direct drivers. As well as a pan-sectoral approach to conserving and restoring the nature that underpins many goals, this transformation will need innovative governance approaches that are adaptive; inclusive; informed by existing and new evidence; and integrative across systems, jurisdictions, and tools. Although the challenge is formidable, every delay will make the task even harder. Crucially, our analysis pinpoints five priority interventions (“levers”) and eight leverage points for intervention in the indirect drivers of global social and economic systems where they can make the biggest difference. Traditional diversity-rich human landscapes, and the livelihoods and identities that depend on them, face global threats. Mosaics of crops, forest, and pasture have been maintained for millennia around the world. Now, they are under increasing threat from climate change and large-scale land use change to accommodate global demands for commodities. So are the livelihoods and cultural identity of the peoples that live in them, such as this woman collecting fodder for her flock in the Checacupe district, Perú. Photo credit www.estebantapella.com The human impact on life on Earth has increased sharply since the 1970s, driven by the demands of a growing population with rising average per capita income. Nature is currently supplying more materials than ever before, but this has come at the high cost of unprecedented global declines in the extent and integrity of ecosystems, distinctness of local ecological communities, abundance and number of wild species, and the number of local domesticated varieties. Such changes reduce vital benefits that people receive from nature and threaten the quality of life of future generations. Both the benefits of an expanding economy and the costs of reducing nature’s benefits are unequally distributed. The fabric of life on which we all depend—nature and its contributions to people—is unravelling rapidly. Despite the severity of the threats and lack of enough progress in tackling them to date, opportunities exist to change future trajectories through transformative action. Such action must begin immediately, however, and address the root economic, social, and technological causes of nature’s deterioration.",https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/366/6471/eaax3100.full.pdf,

Godfray et al. review this trend, which has major negative consequences for land and water use and environmental change. Although meat is a concentrated source of nutrients for low-income families, it also enhances the risks of chronic ill health, such as from colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease. Changing meat consumption habits is a challenge that requires identifying the complex social factors associated with meat eating and developing policies for effective interventions. Science, this issue p. eaam5324 BACKGROUND The global average per capita consumption of meat and the total amount of meat consumed are rising (see the figure), driven by increasing average individual incomes and by population growth. Growth rates vary across different regions, with consumption in high-income countries static or declining and in middle-income countries moderately to strongly increasing, whereas in low-income countries, meat consumption is on average low and stable. There has been a particularly marked increase in the global consumption of chicken and pork. The consumption of different types of meat and meat products has substantial effects on people’s health, and livestock production can have major negative effects on the environment. ADVANCES Meat is a good source of energy and some essential nutrients—including protein and micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12—although it is possible to obtain a sufficient intake of these nutrients without eating meat if a wide variety of other foods is available and consumed. In high-income Western countries, large prospective studies and meta-analyses generally show that total mortality rates are modestly higher in participants who have high intakes of red and processed meat. The strongest evidence of a specific adverse effect is the increased risk of colorectal cancer with high intakes of processed meat. Meat produces more emissions per unit of energy compared with that of plant-based foods because energy is lost at each trophic level. Within types of meat, ruminant production usually leads to more emissions than that of nonruminant mammals, and poultry production usually leads to less emissions than that of mammals. Meat production is the single most important source of methane, which has a relatively high warming potential but a low half-life in the environment compared with that of CO2. Careful management of grassland systems can contribute to carbon storage, but the net benefits are likely to be relatively modest. Agriculture uses more freshwater than any other human activity, with nearly a third required for livestock, so meat production in water-stressed areas is a major competitor with other uses of water, including that required to maintain natural ecosystems. Meat production can be an important source of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other pollutants and affects biodiversity—in particular, through land conversion to pasture and arable feed crops. OUTLOOK Governments act to shape food systems for economic purposes and to protect health from contaminated food. But there is less agreement over the degree to which the state should use health, environmental, or animal welfare considerations to control the supply of meat through interventions that affect the production, sale, processing, and distribution of meat and meat products or the price to the consumer. If we are to shape consumer demand, more evidence is needed about the effectiveness of different interventions to influence food selection. This may include interventions that affect either the conscious, reflective decision-making systems or nonconscious, automatic processes. Potential interventions within the rational choice paradigm include labeling schemes (based on health or environmental criteria) and certification programs (based on welfare or environmental considerations) or fiscal interventions (such as so-called fat taxes). Alternatively, the largely automatic responses to environmental cues that affect purchase and consumption behaviors can be manipulated by changes to the food environment, in retail and food consumption settings. History suggests that change in dietary behaviors in response to interventions is slow. But social norms can and do change, and this process can be aided by the coordinated efforts of civil society, health organizations, and government. However, successful interventions to improve health and environmental objectives are likely to require a good understanding of the impact of meat consumption on these outcomes, as well as a license from society for governments and other bodies to implement a suite of interventions to stimulate change. Total consumption of meat (in million metric tons) in different regions and (inset) globally. [Data are from www.fao.org/faostat/en/?#data.] Both the global average per capita consumption of meat and the total amount of meat consumed are rising, driven by increasing average individual incomes and by population growth. The consumption of different types of meat and meat products has substantial effects on people’s health, and livestock production can have major negative effects on the environment. Here, we explore the evidence base for these assertions and the options policy-makers have should they wish to intervene to affect population meat consumption. We highlight where more research is required and the great importance of integrating insights from the natural and social sciences.",https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6399/eaam5324.full.pdf,

Phytoremediation is an eco-friendly approach that could be a successful mitigation measure to revegetate heavy metal-polluted soil in a cost-effective way. To improve the efficiency of phytoremediation, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying heavy metal accumulation and tolerance in plant is indispensable. In this review, we describe the mechanisms of how heavy metals are taken up, translocated, and detoxified in plants.

The origin of this statement is largely unknown. To assess the rationale for it, the relevant literature was reviewed and data of around 500,000 analyses from the European Food Safety Authority and large global survey for aflatoxins, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol, T-2 and HT-2 toxins, zearalenone and ochratoxin A in cereals and nuts were examined. Using different thresholds, i.e. limit of detection, the lower and upper regulatory limits of European Union (EU) legislation and Codex Alimentarius standards, the mycotoxin occurrence was estimated. Impact of different aspects on uncertainty of the occurrence estimates presented in literature and related to our results are critically discussed. Current mycotoxin occurrence above the EU and Codex limits appears to confirm the FAO 25% estimate, while this figure greatly underestimates the occurrence above the detectable levels (up to 60–80%). The high occurrence is likely explained by a combination of the improved sensitivity of analytical methods and impact of climate change. It is of immense importance that the detectable levels are not overlooked as through diets, humans are exposed to mycotoxin mixtures which can induce combined adverse health effects.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10408398.2019.1658570?needAccess=true,

Since the mid-1990s, significant changes have occurred in when and how glyphosate herbicides are applied, and there has been a dramatic increase in the total volume applied.MethodsData on glyphosate applications were collected from multiple sources and integrated into a dataset spanning agricultural, non-agricultural, and total glyphosate use from 1974–2014 in the United States, and from 1994–2014 globally.ResultsSince 1974 in the U.S., over 1.6 billion kilograms of glyphosate active ingredient have been applied, or 19 % of estimated global use of glyphosate (8.6 billion kilograms). Globally, glyphosate use has risen almost 15-fold since so-called “Roundup Ready,” genetically engineered glyphosate-tolerant crops were introduced in 1996. Two-thirds of the total volume of glyphosate applied in the U.S. from 1974 to 2014 has been sprayed in just the last 10 years. The corresponding share globally is 72 %. In 2014, farmers sprayed enough glyphosate to apply ~1.0 kg/ha (0.8 pound/acre) on every hectare of U.S.-cultivated cropland and nearly 0.53 kg/ha (0.47 pounds/acre) on all cropland worldwide.ConclusionsGenetically engineered herbicide-tolerant crops now account for about 56 % of global glyphosate use. In the U.S., no pesticide has come remotely close to such intensive and widespread use. This is likely the case globally, but published global pesticide use data are sparse. Glyphosate will likely remain the most widely applied pesticide worldwide for years to come, and interest will grow in quantifying ecological and human health impacts. Accurate, accessible time-series data on glyphosate use will accelerate research progress.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12302-016-0070-0,

However, worldwide surveys have documented the contamination and impact of agrochemical residues in soils, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including coastal marine systems, and their toxic effects on humans and nonhuman biota. Although persistent organic chemicals have been phased out and replaced by more biodegradable chemicals, contamination by legacy residues and recent residues still impacts on the quality of human food, water, and environment. Current and future increase in food production must go along with production of food with better quality and with less toxic contaminants. Alternative paths to the intensive use of crop protection chemicals are open, such as genetically engineered organisms, organic farming, change of dietary habits, and development of food technologies. Agro industries need to further develop advanced practices to protect public health, which requires more cautious use of agrochemicals through prior testing, careful risk assessment, and licensing, but also through education of farmers and users in general, measures for better protection of ecosystems, and good practices for sustainable development of agriculture, fisheries, and aquaculture. Enhanced scientific research for new developments in food production and food safety, as well as for environmental protection, is a necessary part of this endeavor.

Although pesticides are developed through very strict regulation processes to function with reasonable certainty and minimal impact on human health and the environment, serious concerns have been raised about health risks resulting from occupational exposure and from residues in food and drinking water. Occupational exposure to pesticides often occurs in the case of agricultural workers in open fields and greenhouses, workers in the pesticide industry, and exterminators of house pests. Exposure of the general population to pesticides occurs primarily through eating food and drinking water contaminated with pesticide residues, whereas substantial exposure can also occur in or around the home. Regarding the adverse effects on the environment (water, soil and air contamination from leaching, runoff, and spray drift, as well as the detrimental effects on wildlife, fish, plants, and other non-target organisms), many of these effects depend on the toxicity of the pesticide, the measures taken during its application, the dosage applied, the adsorption on soil colloids, the weather conditions prevailing after application, and how long the pesticide persists in the environment. Therefore, the risk assessment of the impact of pesticides either on human health or on the environment is not an easy and particularly accurate process because of differences in the periods and levels of exposure, the types of pesticides used (regarding toxicity and persistence), and the environmental characteristics of the areas where pesticides are usually applied. Also, the number of the criteria used and the method of their implementation to assess the adverse effects of pesticides on human health could affect risk assessment and would possibly affect the characterization of the already approved pesticides and the approval of the new compounds in the near future. Thus, new tools or techniques with greater reliability than those already existing are needed to predict the potential hazards of pesticides and thus contribute to reduction of the adverse effects on human health and the environment. On the other hand, the implementation of alternative cropping systems that are less dependent on pesticides, the development of new pesticides with novel modes of action and improved safety profiles, and the improvement of the already used pesticide formulations towards safer formulations (e.g., microcapsule suspensions) could reduce the adverse effects of farming and particularly the toxic effects of pesticides. In addition, the use of appropriate and well-maintained spraying equipment along with taking all precautions that are required in all stages of pesticide handling could minimize human exposure to pesticides and their potential adverse effects on the environment.",https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/8/5/1402/pdf?version=1403139067,

As a result, research into alternative solutions to protect crops has been imposed and attracted wide attention from researchers worldwide.

This Review highlights climate change as an additional amplifier of agriculture’s environmental impacts, by reducing agricultural productivity, reducing the efficacy of agrochemicals, increasing soil erosion, accelerating the growth and expanding the range of crop diseases and pests, and increasing land clearing. We identify multiple pathways through which climate change intensifies agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, creating a potentially powerful climate change–reinforcing feedback loop. The challenges raised by climate change underscore the urgent need to transition to sustainable, climate-resilient agricultural systems. This requires investments that both accelerate adoption of proven solutions that provide multiple benefits, and that discover and scale new beneficial processes and food products. Editor’s summary Intensive agriculture creates multiple environmental challenges, including runoff of excess nutrients, use of chemical pesticides, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions. Curbing these negative effects of agriculture while feeding a growing global population is already a massive challenge and one that will likely be exacerbated by climate change. Yang et al. reviewed the research on interactions between climate change and agriculture’s environmental impacts and found that most of this work suggests even greater challenges to come. —Bianca Lopez BACKGROUND Modern agriculture has large global environmental impacts, from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to water and air pollution to biodiversity loss. It is widely expected that agriculture’s environmental impacts will escalate because a growing and richer global population will likely demand more agricultural products, including foods, feeds, fibers, and biofuels. Climate change, though less studied in this regard, is a second potential amplifier of agricultural environmental impacts. As climate change intensifies, it not only poses great risks to agricultural productivity, but its deviation from the relatively stable state under which modern agriculture evolved and has long operated also has profound implications for how agriculture interacts with the environment, and vice versa. In this Review, we present a synthesis of how climate change could amplify the environmental impacts of agriculture, from increases in GHG emissions, water use and scarcity, soil erosion, nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, pest outbreaks and pesticide use and pollution, and biodiversity loss. We discuss solutions to the challenges raised by how climate change could affect agricultural sustainability. ADVANCES Two major findings emerge from our synthesis. First, climate change will likely exacerbate the already large environmental impacts of agricultural production. It would do so by (i) directly and negatively affecting agricultural productivity; (ii) reducing the efficacy of agrochemicals and increasing their loss to the environment; and (iii) increasing crop pests and soil erosion. Yield reductions and loss of fertile soils would lead to increased land clearing and subsequent species extinctions and GHG emissions, and/or to agrochemical intensification to retain or increase yields. Greater agrochemical inputs mean greater chemical pollution of the environment and greater GHG emissions. Decreased agrochemical efficacy could also lead to compensatory increases in agrochemical use. These climatic impacts can be independent of, hence additive to or multiplicative of, one another, making climate change a potentially important amplifier of agriculture’s environmental footprints. Second, agriculture already accounts for almost a quarter of global GHG emissions, and agriculture’s response to climate change could create a powerful positive GHG feedback loop through multiple pathways. Climate change could intensify agricultural GHG emissions directly—for example, through increasing CH4 emissions from rice paddies, N2O emissions from soil, and CO2 emissions from land clearing and soil tillage. It could also induce more GHG emissions indirectly—for example, if more agrochemicals are needed to compensate for their reduced efficacy; if drier conditions require more energy- and carbon-intensive irrigation; or if greater losses of nutrients from agricultural fields stimulate more biogenic GHG emissions in aquatic systems. These climate-agriculture feedback effects warrant increased attention. OUTLOOK Agricultural reliability and sustainability are of key long-term importance for human and planetary health. The challenges raised by climate change require accelerated adoption of practices and technologies that improve agriculture’s environmental sustainability and climate resilience, especially those that can simultaneously deliver multiple benefits, such as diversification and integrated soil fertility management. However, socioeconomic barriers impede adoption of sustainable practices and technologies. Improved context-specific understanding of these barriers is urgently needed, as are innovative policies to overcome them. Greater investments in the discovery, adaptation, and cost reduction of emerging agricultural technologies could help make agriculture more reliable, sustainable, and climate resilient, as could the adoption of novel foods and healthier diets that would require far less land, water, and chemicals per capita than at present. Our synthesis also identifies many unanswered questions. Although the direction of climate impacts is often clear, the relevant magnitudes are not. Quantitative assessments from local to global scales will be needed, especially for the climate-agriculture feedback loop. Other feedback loops, such as the climate-agriculture-biodiversity loop, are also complicated and require mechanistic and quantitative analyses.

Soil hydrological functions are critical to combat soil degradation and promote soil restoration. Soil microorganisms affect soil hydrology, but the role of soil microbiota in forming and sustaining soil is not well explored. Case studies indicate the potential of soil microorganisms as game-changers in restoring soil functions. We review the state of the art of microorganism use in land restoration technology, the groups of microorganisms with the greatest potential for soil restoration, knowledge of the effect of microorganisms on soil physical properties, and proposed strategies for the long-term restoration of degraded lands. We also emphasize the need to advance the emerging research field of biophysical landscape interactions to support soil-plant ecosystem restoration practices. Description Microbes repairing degraded soils Soils worldwide have become increasingly degraded by human activities, especially in drylands. Land degradation negatively affects soil hydrological functioning and thereby the ecosystem services that soil provides. Soil microbes may play an important part in the restoration of degraded soils, positively influencing moisture content and other physical features of soil. Coban et al. reviewed recent work on soil hydraulic properties, potential groups of microorganisms for hydrological soil restoration based on their resilience in dry soils, and future strategies for long-term restoration of degraded lands. —AMS A review suggests that soil microorganisms may be the key to the restoration of hydraulic function in soils degraded by human activities. BACKGROUND Soil, the living skin of Earth, provides ecosystem services critical for life: Soil acts as a filter and store of water, provides a growing medium that supplies plants and heterotrophs with water and nutrients, offers habitat for a large diversity of organisms, and is the source of most of our antibiotics. Humanity is increasingly challenged by the combination of climate change, population growth, and land degradation, including carbon loss, biodiversity decline, and erosion. In particular, land degradation reduces soil hydrological functioning and thereby several other ecosystem services. Such impacts occur through alterations of hydraulic functioning, infiltration and soil moisture storage, carbon cycling, biological activity, transport of nutrients and contaminants, and plant growth. Impacts of global environmental change and associated soil degradation need to be understood and reversed as biodiversity, food production, climate regulation, and people’s livelihoods are increasingly affected by soil ecosystem degradation. The interplay between soil biota and soil hydrological functioning plays an essential role in many biogeochemical cycles, including the water and carbon cycles. Microorganisms dominate soil life and perform an array of vital soil functions by regulating nutrient cycling, decomposing organic matter, defining soil structure, suppressing plant diseases, and supporting plant productivity. The presence of microorganisms and their activity can affect soil structure and hydraulic properties in multiple ways. Case studies indicate the potential of microorganisms as game-changers toward the restoration of soil functioning. However, the role of soil microbiota in forming and sustaining soils has historically been overlooked. ADVANCES It has been proposed that microbial communities not only are an indicator of ecosystem health and restoration level but also can be manipulated to enhance the recovery of degraded ecosystems. In the past decade, there have been an increasing number of studies suggesting the use of microorganisms as ecosystem mediators, particularly to enhance crop production and to engineer microorganisms for dryland restoration. Most current experimental approaches focus on monitoring changes in the microbial community that can be correlated with land restoration; however, microorganisms are also facilitators of ecosystem change, not just followers. We review how microorganisms can help address different types of land degradation, with a focus on physical soil loss and transformation, loss of soil chemical properties, and contamination. We discuss potentially the most valuable groups of microorganisms for soil restoration (namely, plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and mycorrhizal fungi), emphasizing drylands and advances in plant-microbe interaction studies. We review known effects of microorganisms on soil physical and, specifically, hydraulic properties at pore scale and discuss future strategies for the long-term restoration of degraded lands. We also identify the methodological challenges that have so far hampered progress in understanding soil biophysical processes. OUTLOOK Microorganisms can play the leading role in restoring degraded lands, improving soil hydraulic properties such as infiltration and water retention and reducing soil hydrophobicity, which together can facilitate ecosystem restoration. We advocate for research on mechanisms to restore degraded soils with the use of microorganisms. Given the critical role of freshwater availability to terrestrial life and the paucity of studies on hydrological restoration, we especially advocate for research on the hydrological restoration of degraded soil using microorganisms. We propose that microorganisms can improve soil hydraulic properties such as infiltration and water retention and reduce soil hydrophobicity. Along with new organic matter derived from microbes, this will promote plant growth and facilitate further ecosystem restoration. Such a restoration strategy requires collaboration across the research fields of microbiology and soil hydrology, of which there has been very little to date. Understanding the dynamics of soil microbes and connected hydrological processes would create the foundation for restoration practices that can return resilience to the soil ecosystem.

In degraded lands, a decrease in soil nutrients and organic matter, deterioration of soil structure, increase in salinity, water deficiency, and physical instability can be observed.

When pesticides are used, the over-application and excess discharge into water bodies during rainfall often lead to death of fish and other aquatic life. Even when the fishes still live, their consumption by humans may lead to the biomagnification of chemicals in the body system and can cause deadly diseases, such as cancer, kidney diseases, diabetes, liver dysfunction, eczema, neurological destruction, cardiovascular diseases, and so on. Equally, synthetic pesticides harm the soil texture, soil microbes, animals, and plants. The dangers associated with the use of synthetic pesticides have necessitated the need for alternative use of organic pesticides (biopesticides), which are cheaper, environment friendly, and sustainable. Biopesticides can be sourced from microbes (e.g., metabolites), plants (e.g., from their exudates, essential oil, and extracts from bark, root, and leaves), and nanoparticles of biological origin (e.g., silver and gold nanoparticles). Unlike synthetic pesticides, microbial pesticides are specific in action, can be easily sourced without the need for expensive chemicals, and are environmentally sustainable without residual effects.

The specific gene family members critical for biosynthesis of key tea metabolites, monomeric galloylated catechins and theanine, are indicated and found to have evolved specifically for these functions in the tea plant lineage. Two whole-genome duplications, critical to gene family evolution for these two metabolites, are identified and dated, but are shown to account for less amplification than subsequent paralogous duplications. These studies lay the foundation for future research to understand and utilize the genes that determine tea quality and its diversity within tea germplasm. Tea, one of the world’s most important beverage crops, provides numerous secondary metabolites that account for its rich taste and health benefits. Here we present a high-quality sequence of the genome of tea, Camellia sinensis var. sinensis (CSS), using both Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies. At least 64% of the 3.1-Gb genome assembly consists of repetitive sequences, and the rest yields 33,932 high-confidence predictions of encoded proteins. Divergence between two major lineages, CSS and Camellia sinensis var. assamica (CSA), is calculated to ∼0.38 to 1.54 million years ago (Mya). Analysis of genic collinearity reveals that the tea genome is the product of two rounds of whole-genome duplications (WGDs) that occurred ∼30 to 40 and ∼90 to 100 Mya. We provide evidence that these WGD events, and subsequent paralogous duplications, had major impacts on the copy numbers of secondary metabolite genes, particularly genes critical to producing three key quality compounds: catechins, theanine, and caffeine. Analyses of transcriptome and phytochemistry data show that amplification and transcriptional divergence of genes encoding a large acyltransferase family and leucoanthocyanidin reductases are associated with the characteristic young leaf accumulation of monomeric galloylated catechins in tea, while functional divergence of a single member of the glutamine synthetase gene family yielded theanine synthetase.

In fact, fertilizers and pesticides play a crucial role in agriculture, representing a powerful tool for growers to increase yield and guarantee continuous productivity throughout the seasons under both optimal and suboptimal conditions. In the last three decades, several technological innovations have been proposed to enhance the sustainability of agricultural production systems, through a significant reduction of synthetic agrochemicals like pesticides and fertilizers. A promising and environmental-friendly innovation would be the use of natural plant biostimulants (PBs) that enhance flowering, plant growth, fruit set, crop productivity, and nutrient use efficiency (NUE), and are able also to improve the tolerance against a wide range of abiotic stressors (Colla and Rouphael, 2015). PBs were initially defined by excluding some functionalities like fertilizers or plant protection products. In 1997, in Grounds Maintenance web-journal, Zhang and Schmidt from the Department of Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, defined PBs as “materials that, in minute quantities, promote plant growth”. By using the statement “minute quantities” for describing PBs, the authors implicitly wanted to discriminate biostimulants from nutrients and soil amendments, which also promote plant growth, but are clearly applied in larger quantities. The PBs mentioned in this web article were two important categories such as humic acids and seaweed extracts, and their action on plants was proposed to be essentially hormonal. In 2012, the European Commission has assigned an ad hoc study on plant biostimulants to evaluate the substances and materials involved, which was published by du Jardin (2012) as: “The Science of Plant Biostimulants A bibliographic Analysis”. Based on the scientific literature (250 scientific articles using the term ‘biostimulant' in their titles and/or abstracts), the following definition was proposed: “Plant biostimulants are substances and materials, with the exception of nutrients and pesticides, which, when applied to plant, seeds or growing substrates in specific formulations, have the capacity to modify physiological processes of plants in a way that provides potential benefits to growth, development and/or stress responses”. du Jardin (2012) concluded that PBs are very heterogeneous materials, and proposed in his study eight categories of substances that acts as biostimulants: humic substances, complex organic materials (obtained from agro-industrial and urban waste products, sewage sludge extracts, composts, and manure), beneficial chemical elements (Al, Co, Na, Se, and Si), inorganic salts including phosphite, seaweed extracts (brown, red, and green",https://fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/511937/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fpls-11-00040.pdf?sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&sig=Mrnucc5DMxtV3l5Uqwi7ZH5gu8B39ocxBOP5nbv3XP4%3D&se=2021-02-16T05%3A50%3A52Z&sp=r&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27fpls-11-00040.pdf,

Throughout this period, IPM has endeavored to promote sustainable forms of agriculture, pursued sharp reductions in synthetic pesticide use, and thereby resolved myriad socio-economic, environmental, and human health challenges. Global pesticide use has, however, largely continued unabated, with negative implications for farmer livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and the human right to food. In this review, we examine how IPM has developed over time and assess whether this concept remains suited to present-day challenges. We believe that despite many good intentions, hard realities need to be faced. 1) We identify the following major weaknesses: i) a multitude of IPM definitions that generate unnecessary confusion; ii) inconsistencies between IPM concepts, practice, and policies; iii) insufficient engagement of farmers in IPM technology development and frequent lack of basic understanding of its underlying ecological concepts. 2) By diverting from the fundamental IPM principles, integration of practices has proceeded along serendipitous routes, proven ineffective, and yielded unacceptable outcomes. 3) We show that in the majority of cases, chemical control still remains the basis of plant health programs. 4) Furthermore, IPM research is often lagging, tends to be misguided, and pays insufficient attention to ecology and to the ecological functioning of agroecosystems. 5) Since the 1960s, IPM rules have been twisted, its foundational concepts have degraded and its serious (farm-level) implementation has not advanced. To remedy this, we are proposing Agroecological Crop Protection as a concept that captures how agroecology can be optimally put to the service of crop protection. Agroecological Crop Protection constitutes an interdisciplinary scientific field that comprises an orderly strategy (and clear prioritization) of practices at the field, farm, and agricultural landscape level and a dimension of social and organizational ecology.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13593-021-00689-w.pdf,

A large consumption of cereal‐based foods with small concentrations and low bioavailability of Zn is the major reason behind this problem. Modern cultivars of cereals have inherently very small concentrations of Zn and cannot meet the human need for Zn. Today, up to 50% of wheat‐cultivated soil globally is considered poor in bioavailable Zn. Agricultural strategies that are used to improve the nutritional value of crop plants are known as biofortification strategies. They include genetic biofortification, which is based on classical plant breeding and genetic engineering for larger nutrient concentrations, and greater agronomic biofortification, which is based on optimized fertilizer applications. This review focuses on agronomic biofortification with Zn, which has proved to be very effective for wheat and also other cereal crops including rice. Molecular and genetic research into Zn uptake, transport and grain deposition in cereals are critically important for identifying ‘bottlenecks’ in the biofortification of food crops with Zn. Transgenic plants with large Zn concentrations in seeds are often tested under controlled laboratory or glasshouse conditions with sufficient available Zn in the growth medium for the entire growth period. However, they might not always show the same performance under ‘real‐world’ conditions with limited chemical availability of Zn and various stress factors such as drought. What purpose can an upgraded transport and storage system serve if the amount of goods to be transported and stored is limited anyway? Given the fact that the Zn concentrations required to achieve a measurable impact on human health are well above those required to avoid any loss of yield from Zn deficiency, providing crop plants with sufficient Zn through the soil and foliar fertilizer strategy under field conditions is critically important for biofortification efforts.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/ejss.12437,

A broad survey of pesticide residues was conducted on samples from migratory and other beekeepers across 23 states, one Canadian province and several agricultural cropping systems during the 2007–08 growing seasons. Methodology/Principal Findings We have used LC/MS-MS and GC/MS to analyze bees and hive matrices for pesticide residues utilizing a modified QuEChERS method. We have found 121 different pesticides and metabolites within 887 wax, pollen, bee and associated hive samples. Almost 60% of the 259 wax and 350 pollen samples contained at least one systemic pesticide, and over 47% had both in-hive acaricides fluvalinate and coumaphos, and chlorothalonil, a widely-used fungicide. In bee pollen were found chlorothalonil at levels up to 99 ppm and the insecticides aldicarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, fungicides boscalid, captan and myclobutanil, and herbicide pendimethalin at 1 ppm levels. Almost all comb and foundation wax samples (98%) were contaminated with up to 204 and 94 ppm, respectively, of fluvalinate and coumaphos, and lower amounts of amitraz degradates and chlorothalonil, with an average of 6 pesticide detections per sample and a high of 39. There were fewer pesticides found in adults and brood except for those linked with bee kills by permethrin (20 ppm) and fipronil (3.1 ppm). Conclusions/Significance The 98 pesticides and metabolites detected in mixtures up to 214 ppm in bee pollen alone represents a remarkably high level for toxicants in the brood and adult food of this primary pollinator. This represents over half of the maximum individual pesticide incidences ever reported for apiaries. While exposure to many of these neurotoxicants elicits acute and sublethal reductions in honey bee fitness, the effects of these materials in combinations and their direct association with CCD or declining bee health remains to be determined.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009754&type=printable,

From the assembly of the genome of Thinopyrum elongatum, a wild relative of wheat used in breeding programs to improve cultivated wheat, Wang et al. cloned a gene that can address both problems (see the Perspective by Wulff and Jones). The encoded glutathione S-transferase detoxifies the trichothecene toxin and, when expressed in wheat, confers resistance to FHB. Science, this issue p. eaba5435; see also p. 822 A wild relative of cultivated wheat offers a gene that drives resistance to an agricultural headache. INTRODUCTION Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a fungal disease that devastates global wheat production, with losses of billions of dollars annually. Unlike foliar diseases, FHB occurs directly on wheat spikes (inflorescences). The infection lowers grain yield and also causes the grain to be contaminated by mycotoxins produced by the Fusarium pathogen, thus imposing health threats to humans and livestock. Although plant breeders have improved wheat resistance to FHB, the lack of wheat strains with stable FHB resistance has limited progress. RATIONALE Many genetic loci in wheat affect FHB resistance but most only have minor effects; only a few exhibit a stable major effect on resistance. Wheat relatives in the Triticeae tribe carry resistant genes to different diseases including FHB and thus can be alternative sources of FHB resistance for wheat breeding. Thinopyrum wheatgrass has been used as a source of beneficial genes transferable to wheat by distant hybridization breeding since the 1930s. Fhb7, a gene transferred from Thinopyrum to wheat, showed a stable large effect on FHB resistance. However, the lack of a Thinopyrum reference genome hampered gene cloning and marker development, delaying the use of Fhb7 in wheat breeding. Here, we cloned Fhb7 using a reference assembly that we generated for Th. elongatum and characterized its resistance mechanisms and evolutionary history. RESULTS Using sequence data from Th. elongatum, we assembled the Triticeae E reference genome with 44,474 high-confidence genes annotated. Using this reference, we genetically mapped Fhb7 and located it to a 245-kb genomic region. We determined a gene encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) as Fhb7 by virus-induced gene silencing and evaluated mutants and transgenic plants. We discovered that Fhb7 detoxifies pathogen-produced trichothecene toxins by conjugating a glutathione (GSH) unit onto the epoxide moieties of type A and B trichothecenes. Fhb7 GST homologs are absent in the plant kingdom, but one sequence showing ~97% identity with Fhb7 was found in endophytic fungi of an Epichloë species that establishes symbiosis with temperate grasses. This result suggests that Fhb7 might have been transferred from Epichloë to Th. elongatum through horizontal gene transfer. Finally, we demonstrated that Fhb7, when introgressed into diverse wheat backgrounds by distant hybridization, confers broad resistance to both FHB and crown rot without penalizing wheat yield. Our results suggest a source of Fusarium resistance for wheat improvement. CONCLUSION Th. elongatum carries biotic and abiotic resistance genes and is a useful resource for wheat breeding. The assembled Th. elongatum reference genome can aid identification and cloning of such genes for wheat improvement. Cloning of Fhb7 revealed that it encodes a GST that can detoxify trichothecene toxins. Thus, Fhb7 resistance differs from Fhb1 resistance, which depends on a reduction of pathogen growth in spikes, although both confer durable resistance. The ability of Fhb7 to detoxify multiple mycotoxins produced by various Fusarium species demonstrates its potential as a source of resistance to the various diseases for which Fusarium trichothecenes are virulence factors. The deployment of Fhb7 in commercial wheat cultivars could alleviate both the food safety issue for consumers and the yield loss problem for growers. Sequence homologies between fungal and plant Fhb7 suggested that horizontal gene transfer may help to shape plant genomes. Fhb7 confers FHB resistance by detoxifying trichothecenes. (A) Fhb7 in Th. elongatum genome likely came from an Epichloë fungus through horizontal gene transfer. Fhb7 drives FHB resistance when introgressed from Thinopyrum into wheat. (B) Fhb7 encodes a GST that detoxifies Fusarium-produced trichothecenes by conjugating GSH (blue) to the epoxy group (red). R1 to R5 refer to the variable groups in trichothecenes. Fusarium head blight (FHB), a fungal disease caused by Fusarium species that produce food toxins, currently devastates wheat production worldwide, yet few resistance resources have been discovered in wheat germplasm. Here, we cloned the FHB resistance gene Fhb7 by assembling the genome of Thinopyrum elongatum, a species used in wheat distant hybridization breeding. Fhb7 encodes a glutathione S-transferase (GST) and confers broad resistance to Fusarium species by detoxifying trichothecenes through de-epoxidation. Fhb7 GST homologs are absent in plants, and our evidence supports that Th. elongatum has gained Fhb7 through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from an endophytic Epichloë species. Fhb7 introgressions in wheat confers resistance to both FHB and crown rot in diverse wheat backgrounds without yield penalty, providing a solution for Fusarium resistance breeding.",,

However, in the last years, several studies highlight the inefficiency and country asymmetries in the use of these fertilizers that generated environmental problems, soil nutritional imbalances and not optimal food production. We have aimed to summarize this information and identify and disentangle the key caveats that should be solved. Inadequate global management of fertilization produces areas with serious nutrient deficits in croplands linked with insufficient access to fertilizers that clearly limit food production, and areas that are overfertilized with the consequent problems of environmental pollution affecting human health. A more efficient use of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizers for food security while preserving the environment is thus needed. Nutrient imbalances, particularly the disequilibrium of the N:P ratio due to the unbalanced release of N and P from anthropogenic activities, mainly by crop fertilization and expanding N-fixing crops that have continuously increased the soil N:P ratio, is another issue to resolve. This imbalance has already affected several terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, altering their species composition and functionality and threatening global biodiversity. The different economic and geopolitical traits of these three main macronutrient fertilizers must be considered. P has the fewest reserves, depending mostly on mineable efforts, with most of the reserves concentrated in very few countries (85% in Morocco). This problem is a great concern for the current and near-future access to P for low-income countries. N is instead readily available due to the well-established and relatively low-cost Haber–Bosch synthesis of ammonium from atmospheric N_2, which is increasingly used, even in some low-income countries producing an increasing imbalance in nutrient ratios with the application of P and K fertilizers. The anthropogenic inputs of these three macronutrients to the environment have reached the levels of the natural fluxes, thereby substantially altering their global cycles. The case of the excess of N fertilization is especially paradigmatic in several areas of the world, where continental water sources have become useless due to the higher nitrate concentrations. The management of N, P and K fertilizers is thus in the center of the main dichotomy between food security and environmentally driven problems, such as climate change or eutrophication/pollution. Such a key role demands new legislation for adopting the well-known and common-sense 4R principle (right nutrient source at the right rate, right time and right place) that would help to ensure the appropriate use of nutrient resources and the optimization of productivity.",https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40066-023-00409-5,

In the absence of adequate sustainable management practices, approximately 92 seems a very small number of metric tons of crop waste is burned every year in India, causing excessive particulate matter emissions and air pollution. Crop residue burning has become a major environmental problem causing health issues as well as contributing to global warming. Composting, biochar production and mechanization are a few effective sustainable techniques that can help to curtail the issue while retaining the nutrients present in the crop residue in the soil. The government of India has attempted to curtail this problem, through numerous measures and campaigns designed to promote sustainable management methods such as converting crop residue into energy. However, the alarming rise of air pollution levels caused by crop residue burning in the city of Delhi and other northern areas in India observed in recent years, especially in and after the year of 2015, suggest that the issues is not yet under control. The solution to crop residue burning lies in the effective implementation of sustainable management practices with Government interventions and policies. This manuscript addresses the underlying technical as well as policy issues that has prevented India from achieving a long-lasting solution and also potential solutions that have been overlooked. However, effective implementation of these techniques also requires us to look at other socioeconomic aspects that had not been considered. This manuscript also discusses some of the policy considerations and functionality based on the analyses and current practices. The agricultural waste sector can benefit immensely from some of the examples from other waste sectors such as the municipal solid waste (MSW) and wastewater management where collection, segregation, recycling and disposal are institutionalized to secure an operational system. Active stakeholder involvement including education and empowerment of farmers along with technical solutions and product manufacturing can also assist tremendously. Even though the issue of crop residue burning touches many sectors, such as environment, agriculture, economy, social aspects, education, and energy, the past governmental efforts mainly revolved around agriculture and energy. This sectorial thinking is another barrier that needs to be broken.

Microbiome composition can be rapidly altered by exposure to antibiotics, with potential immediate effects on health, for instance through the selection of resistant opportunistic pathogens that can cause acute disease. Microbiome alterations induced by antibiotics can also indirectly affect health in the long-term. The mutualistic microbes in the human body interact with many physiological processes, and participate in the regulation of immune and metabolic homeostasis. Therefore, antibiotic exposure can alter many basic physiological equilibria, promoting long-term disease. In addition, excessive antibiotic use fosters bacterial resistance, and the overly exposed human microbiome has become a significant reservoir of resistance genes, contributing to the increasing difficulty in controlling bacterial infections. Here, the complex relationships between antibiotics and the human microbiome are reviewed, with focus on the intestinal microbiota, addressing (1) the effects of antibiotic use on the composition and function of the gut microbiota, (2) the impact of antibiotic-induced microbiota alterations on immunity, metabolism, and health, and (3) the role of the gut microbiota as a reservoir of antibiotic resistances.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01543/pdf,

Integrating CCs with existing cropping systems has the potential to enhance ecosystem services such as: (i) food, feed, fi ber, and fuel production, (ii) C and other nutrient and water cycling, and (iii) soil, water, and air quality improvement. Th is is particularly important with increased concerns about the following challenges to agriculture: high production costs, environmental degradation, food security, and climate change. According to the Soil Science Society of America Glossary of Terms, CCs are defi ned as a “close-growing crop that provides soil protection, seeding protection, and soil improvement between periods of normal crop production, or between trees in orchards and vines in vineyards. When plowed under and incorporated into the soil, CCs may be referred to as green manure crops” (SSSA, 2008). While the use of CCs is not a new concept, the implications of their re-emerging importance and impacts on ecosystem services such as crop and livestock production and soil and environmental quality deserve further discussion. Historically, CCs have been used to meet a few specifi c needs (i.e., soil conservation, N2 fi xation, and weed and pest management), but now CC management questions increasingly revolve around the potential multi-functionality of CCs including soil C sequestration, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, benefi ts to “soil health,” feed for livestock, biofuel production, farm economics, and others. Th ere are many studies on CCs assessing soil and crop production, but few have attempted to discuss or integrate all the multiple ecosystem services that CCs provide (Dabney et al., 2001; Snapp et al., 2005).

In this regard, accurate monitoring of food quality and spoilage is necessary to diminish both health hazards and food waste.

Since the late 1970s, the volume of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) applied has increased approximately 100-fold. Further increases in the volume applied are likely due to more and higher rates of application in response to the widespread emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds and new, pre-harvest, dessicant use patterns. GBHs were developed to replace or reduce reliance on herbicides causing well-documented problems associated with drift and crop damage, slipping efficacy, and human health risks. Initial industry toxicity testing suggested that GBHs posed relatively low risks to non-target species, including mammals, leading regulatory authorities worldwide to set high acceptable exposure limits. To accommodate changes in GBH use patterns associated with genetically engineered, herbicide-tolerant crops, regulators have dramatically increased tolerance levels in maize, oilseed (soybeans and canola), and alfalfa crops and related livestock feeds. Animal and epidemiology studies published in the last decade, however, point to the need for a fresh look at glyphosate toxicity. Furthermore, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer recently concluded that glyphosate is “probably carcinogenic to humans.” In response to changing GBH use patterns and advances in scientific understanding of their potential hazards, we have produced a Statement of Concern drawing on emerging science relevant to the safety of GBHs. Our Statement of Concern considers current published literature describing GBH uses, mechanisms of action, toxicity in laboratory animals, and epidemiological studies. It also examines the derivation of current human safety standards. We conclude that: (1) GBHs are the most heavily applied herbicide in the world and usage continues to rise; (2) Worldwide, GBHs often contaminate drinking water sources, precipitation, and air, especially in agricultural regions; (3) The half-life of glyphosate in water and soil is longer than previously recognized; (4) Glyphosate and its metabolites are widely present in the global soybean supply; (5) Human exposures to GBHs are rising; (6) Glyphosate is now authoritatively classified as a probable human carcinogen; (7) Regulatory estimates of tolerable daily intakes for glyphosate in the United States and European Union are based on outdated science. We offer a series of recommendations related to the need for new investments in epidemiological studies, biomonitoring, and toxicology studies that draw on the principles of endocrinology to determine whether the effects of GBHs are due to endocrine disrupting activities. We suggest that common commercial formulations of GBHs should be prioritized for inclusion in government-led toxicology testing programs such as the U.S. National Toxicology Program, as well as for biomonitoring as conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12940-016-0117-0,

It expressively alters biodiversity, agricultural production, and food security. Mainly, narrowly adapted and endemic species are under extinction. Accordingly, concerns over species extinction are warranted as it provides food for all life forms and primary health care for more than 60–80% of humans globally. Nevertheless, the impact of climate change on biodiversity and food security has been recognized, little is explored compared to the magnitude of the problem globally. Therefore, the objectives of this review are to identify, appraise, and synthesize the link between climate change, biodiversity, and food security. Data, climatic models, emission, migration, and extinction scenarios, and outputs from previous publications were used. Due to climate change, distributions of species have shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 m and 16.9 km per decade to higher latitudes. Accordingly, extinction rates of 1103 species under migration scenarios, provide 21–23% with unlimited migration and 38–52% with no migration. When an environmental variation occurs on a timescale shorter than the life of the plant any response could be in terms of a plastic phenotype. However, phenotypic plasticity could buffer species against the long-term effects of climate change. Furthermore, climate change affects food security particularly in communities and locations that depend on rain-fed agriculture. Crops and plants have thresholds beyond which growth and yield are compromised. Accordingly, agricultural yields in Africa alone could be decline by more than 30% in 2050. Therefore, solving food shortages through bringing extra land into agriculture and exploiting new fish stocks is a costly solution, when protecting biodiversity is given priority. Therefore, mitigating food waste, compensating food-insecure people conserving biodiversity, effective use of genetic resources, and traditional ecological knowledge could decrease further biodiversity loss, and meet food security under climate change scenarios. However, achieving food security under such scenario requires strong policies, releasing high-yielding stress resistant varieties, developing climate resilient irrigation structures, and agriculture. Therefore, degraded land restoration, land use changes, use of bio-energy, sustainable forest management, and community based biodiversity conservation are recommended to mitigate climate change impacts.",https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40066-021-00318-5,

Reducing the use of agricultural chemicals to an optimal level is a crucial challenge for the sustainable development of agriculture. We demonstrate that small farm size (in China, typically ∼0.1 ha for each parcel) is strongly related to overuse of agricultural chemicals. Farm size increases with economic development in many other countries, but this is not observed in China due to national policies. Increasing farm size by removing policy distortions would substantially decrease both the use of agricultural chemicals and their environmental impact, while increasing rural income in China. Understanding the reasons for overuse of agricultural chemicals is critical to the sustainable development of Chinese agriculture. Using a nationally representative rural household survey from China, we found that farm size is a strong factor that affects the use intensity of agricultural chemicals across farms in China. Statistically, a 1% increase in farm size is associated with a 0.3% and 0.5% decrease in fertilizer and pesticide use per hectare (P < 0.001), respectively, and an almost 1% increase in agricultural labor productivity, while it only leads to a statistically insignificant 0.02% decrease in crop yields. The same pattern was also found using other independently collected data sources from China and an international panel analysis of 74 countries from the 1960s to the 2000s. While economic growth has been associated with increasing farm size in many other countries, in China this relationship has been distorted by land and migration policies, leading to the persistence of small farm size in China. Removing these distortions would decrease agricultural chemical use by 30–50% and the environmental impact of those chemicals by 50% while doubling the total income of all farmers including those who move to urban areas. Removing policy distortions is also likely to complement other remedies to the overuse problem, such as easing farmer’s access to modern technologies and knowledge, and improving environmental regulation and enforcement.",https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/27/7010.full.pdf,

Rapid industrialization, emissions from automobiles, agricultural inputs, improper disposal of waste, etc., are the major causes of soil contamination with heavy metals. These contaminants not only contaminate soil but also groundwater, reducing agricultural land and hence food quality. These contaminants enter the food chain and have a severe effect on human health. It is important to remove these contaminants from the soil. Various economic and ecological strategies are required to restore the soils contaminated with heavy metals. Phytoremediation is an emerging technology that is non-invasive, cost-effective, and aesthetically pleasing. Many metal-binding proteins (MBPs) of the plants are significantly involved in the phytoremediation of heavy metals; the MBPs include metallothioneins; phytochelatins; metalloenzymes; metal-activated enzymes; and many metal storage proteins, carrier proteins, and channel proteins. Plants are genetically modified to enhance their phytoremediation capacity. In Arabidopsis, the expression of the mercuric ion-binding protein in Bacillus megaterium improves the metal accumulation capacity. The phytoremediation efficiency of plants is also enhanced when assisted with microorganisms, biochar, and/or chemicals. Removing heavy metals from agricultural land without challenging food security is almost impossible. As a result, crop selections with the ability to sequester heavy metals and provide food security are in high demand. This paper summarizes the role of plant proteins and plant–microbe interaction in remediating soils contaminated with heavy metals.

Farming practices have shown that organic farming and tillage improve soil health by increasing the abundance, diversity, and activity of microorganisms. Conservation tillage can potentially increase grower’s profitability by reducing inputs and labor costs as compared to conventional tillage while organic farming might add extra management costs due to high labor demands for weeding and pest control, and for fertilizer inputs (particularly N-based), which typically have less consistent uniformity and stability than synthetic fertilizers.

But what is Regenerative Agriculture, and why is it gaining such prominence? Which problems does it solve, and how? Here we address these questions from an agronomic perspective. The term Regenerative Agriculture has actually been in use for some time, but there has been a resurgence of interest over the past 5 years. It is supported from what are often considered opposite poles of the debate on agriculture and food. Regenerative Agriculture has been promoted strongly by civil society and NGOs as well as by many of the major multi-national food companies. Many practices promoted as regenerative, including crop residue retention, cover cropping and reduced tillage are central to the canon of ‘good agricultural practices’, while others are contested and at best niche (e.g. permaculture, holistic grazing). Worryingly, these practices are generally promoted with little regard to context. Practices most often encouraged (such as no tillage, no pesticides or no external nutrient inputs) are unlikely to lead to the benefits claimed in all places. We argue that the resurgence of interest in Regenerative Agriculture represents a re-framing of what have been considered to be two contrasting approaches to agricultural futures, namely agroecology and sustainable intensification, under the same banner. This is more likely to confuse than to clarify the public debate. More importantly, it draws attention away from more fundamental challenges.

This survey includes wireless communication technologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms used to obtain spectral images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral images and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a case study showing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an IoT-based smart solution for crop health monitoring, which is comprised of two modules. The first module is a wireless sensor network-based system to monitor real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude remote sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed to classify healthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained using a case study and list the challenges and future directions based on our work.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/17/3796/pdf?version=1567419401,

This review discusses the deleterious effects of Cd in plants and the tolerance and resistance mechanisms that evolved to help mitigate cadmium toxicity. Cadmium reduces seed germination, early seedling growth, and plant biomass. It causes changes in photosynthesis, relative water content, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and electrolyte leakage. Cadmium activates the reactive oxygen species that induce chromosomal aberrations, gene mutations, and DNA damage that affect the cell cycle and cell division. In response, plants have applied several adaptive strategies to overcome and reduce the toxic effects of Cd. The primary detoxification mechanisms are exclusion and accumulation of Cd in specific plant parts. Plants also adapt to Cd toxicity with the help of signaling pathways that regulate survival and growth under Cd stress. Other mechanisms such as synthesis of plants hormones, activation of the antioxidant system and the production of phytochelatins and proline are extremely helpful in plant tolerance to Cd. Furthermore, soil microorganisms play a crucial role toward the Cd tolerance in plants by decreasing metal phytoavailability and increasing morphological and physiological parameters of plant.

In addition, the impacts of biochar addition on salt-affected and heavy metal contaminated soils were also reviewed. An ample body of literature supports the idea that soil amended with biochar has a high potential to increase crop productivity due to the concomitant improvement in soil structure, high nutrient use efficiency (NUE), aeration, porosity, and water-holding capacity (WHC), among other soil amendments. However, the increases in crop productivity in biochar-amended soils are most frequently reported in the coarse-textured and sandy soils compared with the fine-textured and fertile soils. Biochar has a significant effect on soil microbial community composition and abundance. The negative impacts that salt-affected and heavy metal polluted soils have on plant growth and yield and on components of soil quality such as soil aggregation and stability can be ameliorated by the application of biochar. Moreover, most of the positive impacts of biochar application have been observed when biochar was applied with other organic and inorganic amendments and fertilizers. Biochar addition to the soil can decrease the nitrogen (N) leaching and volatilization as well as increase NUE.

The extent of salinity affected area is expected to cover about 50% of total agricultural land by 2050. Salinity stress produces various detrimental effects on plants’ physiological, biochemical, and molecular features and reduces productivity. The poor plant growth under salinity stress is due to reduced nutrient mobilization, hormonal imbalance, and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ionic toxicity, and osmotic stress. Additionally, salinity also modulates physicochemical properties and reduces the microbial diversity of soil and thus decreases soil health. On the other hand, the demand for crop production is expected to increase in coming decades owing to the increasing global population. Conventional agricultural practices and improved salt-tolerant crop varieties will not be sufficient to achieve the yields desired in the near future. Plants harbor diverse microbes in their rhizosphere, and these have the potential to cope with the salinity stress. These salinity-tolerant plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) assist the plants in withstanding saline conditions. These plant-associated microbes produce different compounds such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), antioxidants, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Additionally, the naturally associated microbiome of plants has the potential to protect the host through stress avoidance, tolerance, and resistance strategies. Recent developments in microbiome research have shown ways in which novel microbe-assisted technologies can enhance plant salt tolerance and enable higher crop production under saline conditions.

This increased population density is projected to increase demand for food production by 70 % notably due to changes in dietary habits in developing countries towards high quality food, e.g. greater consumption of meat and milk products and to the increasing use of grains for livestock feed. The availability of additional agricultural land is limited. Any expansion will happen mostly at the expense of forests and the natural habitats containing wildlife, wild relatives of crops and natural enemies of crop pests. Furthermore, more agricultural land will be used to produce bio-based commodities such as biofuel or fibre instead of food. Thus, we need to grow food on even less land, with less water, using less energy, fertiliser and pesticide than we use today. Given these limitations, sustainable production at elevated levels is urgently needed. The reduction of current yield losses caused by pests is a major challenge to agricultural production. This review presents (1) worldwide crop losses due to pests, (2) estimates of pesticide-related productivity, and costs and benefits of pesticide use, (3) approaches to reduce yield losses by chemical, as well as biological and recombinant methods of pest control and (4) the challenges of the crop-protection industry.

Resilient, productive soils are necessary to sustainably intensify agriculture to increase yields while minimizing environmental harm. To conserve and regenerate productive soils, the need to maintain and build soil organic matter (SOM) has received considerable attention. Although SOM is considered key to soil health, its relationship with yield is contested because of local-scale differences in soils, climate, and farming systems. There is a need to quantify this relationship to set a general framework for how soil management could potentially contribute to the goals of sustainable intensification. We developed a quantitative model exploring how SOM relates to crop yield potential of maize and wheat in light of co-varying factors of management, soil type, and climate. We found that yields of these two crops are on average greater with higher concentrations of SOC (soil organic carbon). However, yield increases level off at ∼2 % SOC. Nevertheless, approximately two-thirds of the world's cultivated maize and wheat lands currently have SOC contents of less than 2 %. Using this regression relationship developed from published empirical data, we then estimated how an increase in SOC concentrations up to regionally specific targets could potentially help reduce reliance on nitrogen (N) fertilizer and help close global yield gaps. Potential N fertilizer reductions associated with increasing SOC amount to 7 % and 5 % of global N fertilizer inputs across maize and wheat fields, respectively. Potential yield increases of 10±11 % (mean ± SD) for maize and 23±37 % for wheat amount to 32 % of the projected yield gap for maize and 60 % of that for wheat. Our analysis provides a global-level prediction for relating SOC to crop yields. Further work employing similar approaches to regional and local data, coupled with experimental work to disentangle causative effects of SOC on yield and vice versa, is needed to provide practical prescriptions to incentivize soil management for sustainable intensification.",https://soil.copernicus.org/articles/5/15/2019/soil-5-15-2019.pdf,

However, complex edaphic processes cause P to be immobilized in soil, hampering its timely and sufficient availability for uptake by plants. The resultant low use efficiency of current water-soluble P fertilizers creates significant environmental and human health problems. Current practices to increase P use efficiency have been inadequate to curtail these problems. We advocate for the understanding of plant physiological processes, such as physiological P requirement, storage of excess P as phytate, and plant uptake mechanisms, to identify novel ways of designing and delivering P fertilizers to plants for improved uptake. We note the importance and implications of the contrasting role of micronutrients such as zinc and iron in stimulating P availability under low soil P content, while inhibiting P uptake under high P fertilization; this could provide an avenue for managing P for plant use under different P fertilization regimes. We argue that the improvement of the nutritional value of crops, especially cereals, through reduced phytic acid and increased zinc and iron contents should be among the most important drivers toward the development of innovative fertilizer products and fertilization technologies. In this paper, we present various pathways in support of this argument. Retuning P fertilizer products and application strategies will contribute to fighting hunger and micronutrient deficiencies in humans.

Poor people and poor countries are already vulnerable to all types of climate-related shocks—natural disasters that destroy assets and livelihoods; water borne diseases and pests that becomemore prevalent during heat waves, floods, or droughts; crop failure from reduced rainfall; andspikes in food prices that follow extreme weather events. Such shocks can erase decades ofhard work and leave people with irreversible human and physical losses. Changes in climateconditions caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will worsen these shocks and slow down poverty reduction. The good news is that, at least until 2030, “good development” can prevent most of these impacts. By “good development,” we mean development that is rapid, inclusive, and climate informed; includes strong social safety nets and universal health coverage; and iscomplemented with targeted adaptation interventions such as heat-tolerant crops and early warning systems. Absent such good development, many people will still be living in or closeto extreme poverty in 2030, with few resources to cope with climate shocks and adapt to longterm trends, and climate change could increase extreme poverty by more than 100 million people by 2030. In the longer run, beyond 2030, our ability to adapt to unabated climate change is limited. To keep the longer-term impacts on poverty in check, immediate emissions-reduction policiesare needed that bring emissions to zero by the end of the 21st century.

Regenerative agriculture (RA) is purported by advocates as a solution to these issues that focuses on soil health and carbon sequestration. The fundamental principles of RA are to keep the soil covered, minimise soil disturbance, preserve living roots in the soil year round, increase species diversity, integrate livestock, and limit or eliminate the use of synthetic compounds (such as herbicides and fertilisers). The overall objectives are to rejuvenate the soil and land and provide environmental, economic, and social benefits to the wider community. Despite the purported benefits of RA, a vast majority of growers are reluctant to adopt these practices due to a lack of empirical evidence on the claimed benefits and profitability. We examined the reported benefits and mechanisms associated with RA against available scientific data. The literature suggests that agricultural practices such as minimum tillage, residue retention, and cover cropping can improve soil carbon, crop yield, and soil health in certain climatic zones and soil types. Excessive use of synthetic chemicals can lead to biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Combining livestock with cropping and agroforestry in the same landscape can increase soil carbon and provide several co-benefits. However, the benefits of RA practices can vary among different agroecosystems and may not necessarily be applicable across multiple agroecological regions. Our recommendation is to implement rigorous long-term farming system trials to compare conventional and RA practices in order to build knowledge on the benefits and mechanisms associated with RA on regional scales. This will provide growers and policy-makers with an evidence base from which to make informed decisions about adopting RA practices to realise their social and economic benefits and achieve resilience against climate change.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/3/2338/pdf?version=1675767528,

By providing a particular habitat, refugia for epigenic organisms, microclimate heterogeneity, buffering action, soil moisture, and humidity, agroforestry can enhance biodiversity more than monocropping. Various studies confirmed the internal restoration potential of agroforestry. Agroforestry reduces runoff, intercepts rainfall, and binds soil particles together, helping in erosion control.

Although ruminants have a unique advantage of being able to consume forages and graze lands not suitable for arable cropping, 2% to 12% of the gross energy consumed is converted to enteric CH4 during ruminal digestion, which contributes approximately 6% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, ruminant producers need to find cost-effective ways to reduce emissions while meeting consumer demand for food. This paper provides a critical review of the substantial amount of ruminant CH4-related research published in past decades, highlighting hydrogen flow in the rumen, the microbiome associated with methanogenesis, current and future prospects for CH4 mitigation and insights into future challenges for science, governments, farmers and associated industries. Methane emission intensity, measured as emissions per unit of meat and milk, has continuously declined over the past decades due to improvements in production efficiency and animal performance, and this trend is expected to continue. However, continued decline in emission intensity will likely be insufficient to offset the rising emissions from increasing demand for animal protein. Thus, decreases in both emission intensity (g CH4/animal product) and absolute emissions (g CH4/day) are needed if the ruminant industries continue to grow. Providing producers with cost-effective options for decreasing CH4 emissions is therefore imperative, yet few cost-effective approaches are currently available. Future abatement may be achieved through animal genetics, vaccine development, early life programming, diet formulation, use of alternative hydrogen sinks, chemical inhibitors and fermentation modifiers. Individually, these strategies are expected to have moderate effects (<20% decrease), with the exception of the experimental inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol for which decreases in CH4 have consistently been greater (20% to 40% decrease). Therefore, it will be necessary to combine strategies to attain the sizable reduction in CH4 needed, but further research is required to determine whether combining anti-methanogenic strategies will have consistent additive effects. It is also not clear whether a decrease in CH4 production leads to consistent improved animal performance, information that will be necessary for adoption by producers. Major constraints for decreasing global enteric CH4 emissions from ruminants are continued expansion of the industry, the cost of mitigation, the difficulty of applying mitigation strategies to grazing ruminants, the inconsistent effects on animal performance and the paucity of information on animal health, reproduction, product quality, cost-benefit, safety and consumer acceptance.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1751731119003100,

Reviewed literature shows that HA can positively affect soil physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, including texture, structure, water holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, pH, soil carbon, enzymes, nitrogen cycling, and nutrient availability. This review highlights the relevance of HA on crop growth, plant hormone production, nutrient uptake and assimilation, yield, and protein synthesis. The effect of HA on soil properties and crops is influenced by the HA type, HA application rate, HA application mode, soil type, solubility, molecular size, and functional group. This review also identifies some knowledge gaps in HA studies. HA and its application rate have not been tested in field experiments under different crops in rotation, nitrogen fertilizer forms, sites and climatic conditions. Furthermore, HA chemical and molecular structures, their water and alkaline soluble fractions have not been tested under field experiments to evaluate their effects on crop yield, quality, and soil health.

There are numerous approaches to calculate NUE, but it is difficult to find an authoritative resource that collates the various NUE indices and systematically identifies their assets and shortcomings. Furthermore, there is reason to question the usefulness of many traditional NUE formulations, and to consider factors to improve the conceptualization of NUE for future use. As a resource for agricultural researchers and students, here we present a comprehensive list of NUE indices and discuss their functions, strengths, and limitations. We also suggest several factors—which are currently ignored in traditional NUE indices—that will improve the conceptualization of NUE, such as: accounting for a wider range of soil N forms, considering how plants mediate their response to the soil N status, including the below-ground/root N pools, capturing the synchrony between available N and plant N demand, blending agronomic performance with ecosystem functioning, and affirming the biological meaning of NUE.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.637108/pdf,

The rhizosphere conditions have a direct impact on crop growth and yield. Nutrient-rich rhizosphere environments stimulate plant growth and yield and vice versa. Extensive cultivation exhaust most of the soils which need to be nurtured before or during the next crop. Chemical fertilizers are the major source of crop nutrients but their uncontrolled and widespread usage has posed a serious threat to the sustainability of agriculture and stability of an ecosystem. These chemicals are accumulated in the soil, drained in water, and emitted to the air where they persist for decades causing a serious threat to the overall ecosystem. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) present in the rhizosphere convert many plant-unavailable essential nutrients e.g., nitrogen, phosphorous, zinc, etc. into available forms. PGPR produces certain plant growth hormones (such as auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellin), cell lytic enzymes (chitinase, protease, hydrolases, etc.), secondary metabolites, and antibiotics, and stress alleviating compounds (e.g., 1-Aminocyclopropane-1- carboxylate deaminase), chelating agents (siderophores), and some signaling compounds (e.g., N-Acyl homoserine lactones) to interact with the beneficial or pathogenic counterparts in the rhizosphere. These multifarious activities of PGPR improve the soil structure, health, fertility, and functioning which directly or indirectly support plant growth under normal and stressed environments. Rhizosphere engineering with these PGPR has a wide-ranging application not only for crop fertilization but developing eco-friendly sustainable agriculture. Due to severe climate change effects on plants and rhizosphere biology, there is growing interest in stress-resilient PGPM and their subsequent application to induce stress (drought, salinity, and heat) tolerance mechanism in plants. This review describes the three components of rhizosphere engineering with an explicit focus on the broader perspective of PGPM that could facilitate rhizosphere engineering in selected hosts to serve as an efficient component for sustainable agriculture.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2021.617157/pdf,

Based on the photovoltaic effect, self-powered UV photodetectors can measure and monitor UV radiation without any power consumption. However, the current low photoelectric performance of these detectors has hindered their practical use. In our study, a super-high-performance self-powered UV photodetector based on a GaN/Sn:Ga2O3 pn junction was generated by depositing a Sn-doped n-type Ga2O3 thin film onto a p-type GaN thick film. The responsivity at 254 nm reached up to 3.05 A/W without a power supply and had a high UV/visible rejection ratio of R254 nm/ R400 nm = 5.9 × 103 and an ideal detectivity at 1.69 × 1013 cm·Hz1/2·W-1, which is well beyond the level of previous self-powered UV photodetectors. Moreover, our device also has a low dark current (1.8 × 10-11A), a high Iphoto/ Idark ratio (∼104), and a fast photoresponse time of 18 ms without bias. These outstanding performance results are attributed to the rapid separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs driven by a high built-in electric field in the interface depletion region of the GaN/Sn:Ga2O3 pn junction. Our results provide an improved and easy route to constructing high-performance self-powered UV photodetectors that can potentially replace traditional high-energy-consuming UV detection systems.",,

The current technologies used for genome editing include ZFN (zinc-finger nuclease), meganucleases, TALEN (Transcription activa-tor-like effector nucleases), etc. [1]. These technologies can generate double stranded breaks (DSBs) to either disrupt gene function through generation of premature stop codons by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, or to facilitate gene targeting through homolo-gous recombination (HR) with an incoming template. Recently, a new technology for genome editing, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) systems, has been developed [2]. CRISPR/Cas systems are adaptive defense systems in prokaryotic organisms to fight against alien nucleic acids [3]. The spacer sequences acquired from foreign DNA are positioned between host repeats, and transcribed together as CRISPR RNA (crRNA). In the type II CRISPR system, a single nuclease Cas9, guided by a dual-crRNA:tracrRNA, is sufficient to cleave cog-nate DNA homologous to the spacer [2]. Efficient cleav-age also requires the presence of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) 5′-NGG-3′ following the spacer sequence. The dual-crRNA:tracrRNA has been further streamlined to a single RNA chimera, called sgRNA (single guide RNA) [2]. Compared with protein-guided technologies, CRISPR/Cas system is much easier to implement, as only short guide RNAs need to be customized to target the genes of interest. Up to now, the CRISPR/Cas system has been successfully applied to efficient genome editing in many eukaryotic organisms including human [1], mice [4], zebra fish [5], fly [6], worm [7], and yeast [8]. However, the application of CRISPR/Cas system in plants has not been reported. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a major staple crop in the grass family (Poaceae), feeding half of the world's population. Rice is also used as a model monocot plant for biological studies because it has a relatively small genome compared to other cereal crops and is easy to be manipulated genetically. We demonstrate in this study that the CRISPR/Cas technology can achieve efficient targeted mutagenesis in transgenic rice. Our work paves the way for large-scale genome editing in rice, which is important for quality improvement and yield increase of rice. To accommodate the CRISPR/Cas system to Agro-bacterium-mediated plant transformation, we designed Gateway TM binary T-DNA vectors for co-expression of CAS9 and guide RNA (either sgRNA or dual-crRNA:tracrRNA, see Figure 1A). Gene-specific spacer sequence was cloned into entry vectors for expression of guide RNA (Supplementary information, Figure S1 and …",https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013123.pdf,

However, the efficacy of PGPR as bioinoculants can be diminished by a low capacity to colonize spaces in the rhizosphere. In this work, we review pioneering and recent developments on several important functions that rhizobacteria exhibit in order to compete, colonize, and establish themselves in the plant rhizosphere. Therefore, the use of highly competitive strains in open field trials should be a priority, in order to have consistent and better results in agricultural production activities. Abstract The application of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in the field has been hampered by a number of gaps in the knowledge of the mechanisms that improve plant growth, health, and production. These gaps include (i) the ability of PGPR to colonize the rhizosphere of plants and (ii) the ability of bacterial strains to thrive under different environmental conditions. In this review, different strategies of PGPR to colonize the rhizosphere of host plants are summarized and the advantages of having highly competitive strains are discussed. Some mechanisms exhibited by PGPR to colonize the rhizosphere include recognition of chemical signals and nutrients from root exudates, antioxidant activities, biofilm production, bacterial motility, as well as efficient evasion and suppression of the plant immune system. Moreover, many PGPR contain secretion systems and produce antimicrobial compounds, such as antibiotics, volatile organic compounds, and lytic enzymes that enable them to restrict the growth of potentially phytopathogenic microorganisms. Finally, the ability of PGPR to compete and successfully colonize the rhizosphere should be considered in the development and application of bioinoculants.",https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/10/6/475/pdf?version=1622116204,

Indeed, across agriculture, such fungal diseases of plants include new devastating epidemics of trees and jeopardize food security worldwide by causing epidemics in staple and commodity crops that feed billions. Further, ingestion of mycotoxins contributes to ill health and causes cancer. Coordinated international research efforts, enhanced technology translation, and greater policy outreach by scientists are needed to more fully understand the biology and drivers that underlie the emergence of fungal diseases and to mitigate against their impacts.
