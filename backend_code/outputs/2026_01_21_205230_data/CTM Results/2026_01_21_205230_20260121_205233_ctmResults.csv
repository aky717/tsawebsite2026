ASD are likely a heterogeneous group of disorders with genetic and environmental causes resulting in similar phenotypes. Genetic contributions to autism are extremely heterogeneous and may involve synaptic formation and maturation. Thus, multiple genes involved in the formation, specification, and maintenance of synapses have been identified as risk factors for ASD development (Hahn et al., 2013). Also the rate of brain growth in the first 2 years of life may contribute to ASD. Although abnormally enlarged brain volumes and increased rates of brain growth during early childhood are observed only in a minority of ASD children, nevertheless there is evidence of abnormalities in posterior lobes and posterior brain networks during the first 2 years of life in ASD (Lainhart, 2015). If the etiology of ASD is still mysterious, there is a growing consensus for the role of neuroinflammation in ASD pathogenesis (Fatemi et al., 2012), and the recent publication in Nature of the existence of the previously unknown meningeal lymphatic system, invites a closer evaluation of its potential significance to brain development (Louveau et al., 2015). In 1983, Aarli speculated the fluid of the brain traveled along mysterious perivascular channels, and noted that immunological challenges could affect the integrity of the blood brain barrier (Aarli, 1983). It was then accepted that the exit pathway for immune cells trafficking through the CNS was via the arachnoid granulations. The new study in Nature provides us with a secondary pathway leading to deep cervical lymph nodes. We concur with the comment (Louveau et al., 2015) that; “the presence of a functional and classical lymphatic system in the central nervous system suggests that current dogmas regarding brain tolerance and the immune privilege of the brain should be revisited.” This feature is critically important with regard to the observations of immunological dysregulation in autism, which intersect with observations of increased extra-axial CSF (EAF) in the autism population. MRI scans were used (Shen et al., 2013) to evaluate the EAF of infants born into families with an existing autistic child. They were able to predict the future onset and severity of autism based on the findings of early and persistent increases in EAF. In a similar way, we were able to demonstrate increased EAF using transcranial ultrasonography and we too observed a correlation between increased severity of autistic symptoms and increased EAF scores (Bradstreet et al., 2014). The mechanisms responsible for such an increased EAF, however, remained unknown. The newly discovered meningeal lymphatic system might help explaining how immunological dysfunctions and peripheral chronic infection/inflammation may affect the meninges and, consequently, brain development. Several evidences point to a connection between meninges and abnormal CNS development. Meningeal cells are involved in cortical development (Dragunow, 2013), and meningeal alterations in mice modeling ASD-like behaviors contribute to incorrect neurogenesis during development (Mercier et al., 2011). In 2012, Zarbalis et al. demonstrated that meningeal defects alter migration of cortical interneurons in a mouse model, thus further stressing the role of the meninges in the establishment of proper neuronal interconnections (Zarbalis et al., 2012). The observations of increased EAF in the autism population with these new observations of a central lymphatic system connected to cervical lymph nodes, should direct more attention to the role of meningeal lymphatics in the pathogenesis of ASD. It further begs the question: “could inflammation-associated deficits in meningeal lymph drainage be the culprit for the observed increased EAF?” Intersecting the increased EAF volume observations in ASD with the EAF drainage to deep cervical lymph nodes draws our attention to the pathogenetic potential of chronic infections leading to inflammation and subsequent deficit in lymphatic drainage. Supporting the role of chronic infection/inflammation in ASD pathogenesis, multiple polyomaviral infections were observed to be significantly more common in the post-mortem brains of ASD individuals (Lintas et al., 2010) and ASD individuals show immune transcriptome alterations in the temporal cortex that seem to indicate immune dysregulation with consequent inflammation (Garbett et al., 2008). Piras et al. (2014) correlated anti-brain antibodies with specific deficits in ASD, thus reinforcing the notion that chronic inflammation is a common denominator that may lead to EAF increase because of impaired meningeal lymphatic drainage. The existence of a classical lymphatic system in the CNS might also explain the nature of the lesions in the brains of autistic subjects, which we observed with ultrasonography and designated “cortical dysplasia” (Bradstreet et al., 2014). Inefficient drainage with focal accumulation of CSF in certain areas of the cortex might explain the hypoechogenic appearance of focal “patches,” which we consistently observed in autistic subjects. Accumulation of fluid that typically appears hypoechogenic in ultrasonography, might thus disrupt neuronal/glial networking by increasing the distance between cells and by increasing extracellular pressure on cells with consequent alteration of gene expression trough modification of the cytoskeleton (Knoll, 2010). Since Stoner et al. (2014) also observed “patches” of decreased transcription in autism related brain bank specimens, it is tempting to speculate that such alterations of gene expression may be associated with the accumulation of EAF and its effects on neuronal and glial function. Finally, transcranial ultrasonography deserves more attention as a harmless and low-cost means of evaluating CSF fluid volumes and stratifying ASD children potentially at-risk for chronic CNS inflammatory disorders. Transcranial ultrasonography enables reproducible evaluation of EAF by measuring the distances between the arachnoid membrane and the cortical pia layer (subarachnoid space), and may thus help establishing the degree of meningeal lymphatic drainage deficit. Since the measures can be easily repeated, the technique could be used for monitoring the progression of the disease or for objectively assessing the efficacy of treatments. In conclusion, the observation by Louveau et al. (2015) leads us to hypothesize that meningeal lymphatic drainage deficit due to peripheral chronic infection/inflammation may be responsible for increased EAF and cortical dysplasia in ASD individuals and, possibly, for some of the symptoms typical of the disorder.","Some recent clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is a key factor that interacts with the three neurobiological correlates of major depressive disorder: depletion of brain serotonin, dysregulation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and alteration of the continuous production of adult‐generated neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. This review discusses the main players in brain immunity as well as how inflammation interacts with the above three mechanisms. It is reported that kynurenine (KYN) pathway alteration in favour of its excitotoxic component and HPA axis dysregulation have the common effect of increasing extracellular glutamate levels and glutamate neurotransmission, which can impact hippocampal neurogenesis. This pathophysiological cascade appears to be triggered or sustained and reinforced by any chronic inflammatory condition involving increased circulating markers of inflammation that are able to cross the blood–brain barrier and activate microglia; it can also be the consequence of primary brain neuroinflammation, such as in neurodegenerative disorders with early manifestations that are frequently depressive symptoms. Further recent data indicate that primary microglial activation may also result from a direct impact of chronic stress on vascular function. The intricated dynamic crosstalk between neuroinflammation and other relevant neurobiological correlates of depression add to evidence that neuroinflammation may be a key therapeutic target for future therapeutic strategies in major depressive disorder.","Adult neurogenesis and Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology destroys neurons and synapses in the brain, leading to dementia. The brain generates new neurons throughout life in the hippocampus, a process called adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Choi et al. found that blocking AHN exacerbated cognitive impairment in an AD mouse model (see the Perspective by Spires-Jones and Ritchie). Inducing neurogenesis alone did not improve cognition in AD mice, whereas inducing neurogenesis while simultaneously ameliorating the neuronal environment via exercise did. The use of genetic or pharmacological treatments that simultaneously induced neurogenesis and increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mimicked the benefits of exercise on cognition. Thus, inducing both neurogenesis and providing BDNF may be useful as an AD therapeutic. Science, this issue p. eaan8821; see also p. 975 Adult neurogenesis plays a critical role in neurodegeneration and cognition in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. INTRODUCTION Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia, characterized by cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and neuroinflammation. The most popular therapeutic approach aimed at reducing Aβ burden has not yet proved effective in halting disease progression. A successful therapy would both remove the pathological hallmarks of the disease and provide some functional recovery. The hippocampus contains neural progenitor cells that continue to generate new neurons, a process called adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). AHN is impaired before the onset of classical AD pathology in AD mouse models. Human AHN has also been reported to be altered in AD patients. However, evidence supporting a role for AHN in AD has remained sparse and inconclusive. RATIONALE Two fundamental questions remain: (i) whether AHN could be enhanced and exploited for therapeutic purposes for AD, and (ii) whether AHN impairment mediates aspects of AD pathogenesis. To address these questions, we increased AHN genetically (WNT3) and pharmacologically (P7C3) in AD transgenic 5×FAD mice and explored whether promoting AHN alone can ameliorate AD pathology and behavioral symptoms. We assessed the role of exercise, a known neurogenic stimulus, and explored whether promoting AHN in conjunction with the salutary biochemical changes induced by exercise can improve AD pathology and behavioral symptoms in mice. We also investigated whether AHN suppression, by irradiation, temozolomide, or dominant-negative WNT, contributes to AD pathogenesis and assessed the functional roles of AHN in AD. RESULTS Inducing AHN alone conferred minimal to no benefit for improving cognition in 5×FAD mice. Exercise-induced AHN improved cognition along with reduced Aβ load and increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), fibronectin type III domain–containing protein–5 (FNDC5), and synaptic markers. However, AHN activation was also required for exercise-induced improvement in memory. Inducing AHN genetically and pharmacologically in combination with elevating BDNF levels mimicked beneficial effects of exercise on AD mice. Conversely, suppressing AHN in early stages of AD exacerbated neuronal vulnerability in later stages of AD, leading to cognitive impairment and increased neuronal loss. However, no such effects from AHN ablation were observed in nontransgenic wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting that AHN has a specific role in AD. CONCLUSION Promoting AHN can only ameliorate AD pathology and cognitive deficits in the presence of a healthier, improved local brain environment, e.g., stimulated by exercise. Increasing AHN alone combined with overexpression of BDNF could mimic exercise-induced improvements in cognition, without reducing Aβ burden. Adult-born neurons generated very early in life are critical for maintaining hippocampal neuronal populations in the hostile brain environment created by AD later in life. Thus, AHN impairment may be a primary event that later mediates other aspects of AD pathogenesis. Future attempts to create pharmacological mimetics of the benefits of exercise on both increased AHN and BDNF may someday provide an effective means for improving cognition in AD. Moreover, increasing neurogenesis in the earliest stages of AD pathogenesis may protect against neuronal cell death later in the disease, providing a potentially powerful disease-modifying treatment strategy for AD. Role of adult-born neurons in AD. Inducing AHN alone by WNT3 and P7C3 together did not prevent cognitive dysfunction, whereas activating AHN through exercise improved memory in 5×FAD mice. Increasing AHN alone together with overexpression of BDNF could mimic exercise-induced improvement in cognition. Suppressing AHN exacerbated neuronal vulnerability, leading to cognitive impairment and increased neuronal loss in 5×FAD mice, but not in WT mice. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is impaired before the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. We found that exercise provided cognitive benefit to 5×FAD mice, a mouse model of AD, by inducing AHN and elevating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Neither stimulation of AHN alone, nor exercise, in the absence of increased AHN, ameliorated cognition. We successfully mimicked the beneficial effects of exercise on AD mice by genetically and pharmacologically inducing AHN in combination with elevating BDNF levels. Suppressing AHN later led to worsened cognitive performance and loss of preexisting dentate neurons. Thus, pharmacological mimetics of exercise, enhancing AHN and elevating BDNF levels, may improve cognition in AD. Furthermore, applied at early stages of AD, these mimetics may protect against subsequent neuronal cell death.","Microglia modulate memories Synaptic reorganization and circuit rewiring leads to loss or weakening of connections between neurons and may result in the erasure of previously formed memories. Microglia eliminate excessive synapses in the developing brain and regulate the dynamics of synaptic connections between neurons throughout life. However, it is still unclear whether forgetting is related to microglia activity and how microglia regulate memory erasure in the adult brain. Wang et al. discovered that microglia eliminated synaptic components in the adult hippocampus and that depleting microglia or inhibiting phagocytosis of microglia prevented forgetting. Synapse elimination by microglia may thus lead to degradation of memory engrams and forgetting of previously learned contextual fear memory. Science, this issue p. 688 Elimination of synapses in the mouse brain by microglia mediates dissociation of engram cells and forgetting of previously learned memories. Synapses between engram cells are believed to be substrates for memory storage, and the weakening or loss of these synapses leads to the forgetting of related memories. We found engulfment of synaptic components by microglia in the hippocampi of healthy adult mice. Depletion of microglia or inhibition of microglial phagocytosis prevented forgetting and the dissociation of engram cells. By introducing CD55 to inhibit complement pathways, specifically in engram cells, we further demonstrated that microglia regulated forgetting in a complement- and activity-dependent manner. Additionally, microglia were involved in both neurogenesis-related and neurogenesis-unrelated memory degradation. Together, our findings revealed complement-dependent synapse elimination by microglia as a mechanism underlying the forgetting of remote memories.","The hippocampus, a brain area critical for learning and memory, is especially vulnerable to damage at early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidence has indicated that altered neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus represents an early critical event in the course of AD. Although causal links have not been established, a variety of key molecules involved in AD pathogenesis have been shown to impact new neuron generation, either positively or negatively. From a functional point of view, hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in structural plasticity and network maintenance. Therefore, dysfunctional neurogenesis resulting from early subtle disease manifestations may in turn exacerbate neuronal vulnerability to AD and contribute to memory impairment, whereas enhanced neurogenesis may be a compensatory response and represent an endogenous brain repair mechanism. Here we review recent findings on alterations of neurogenesis associated with pathogenesis of AD, and we discuss the potential of neurogenesis-based diagnostics and therapeutic strategies for AD.","Hippocampus is the significant component of the limbic lobe, which is further subdivided into the dentate gyrus and parts of Cornu Ammonis. It is the crucial region for learning and memory; its sub-regions aid in the generation of episodic memory. However, the hippocampus is one of the brain areas affected by Alzheimer’s (AD). In the early stages of AD, the hippocampus shows rapid loss of its tissue, which is associated with the functional disconnection with other parts of the brain. In the progression of AD, atrophy of medial temporal and hippocampal regions are the structural markers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lack of sirtuin (SIRT) expression in the hippocampal neurons will impair cognitive function, including recent memory and spatial learning. Proliferation, differentiation, and migrations are the steps involved in adult neurogenesis. The microglia in the hippocampal region are more immunologically active than the other regions of the brain. Intrinsic factors like hormones, glia, and vascular nourishment are instrumental in the neural stem cell (NSC) functions by maintaining the brain’s microenvironment. Along with the intrinsic factors, many extrinsic factors like dietary intake and physical activity may also influence the NSCs. Hence, pro-neurogenic lifestyle could delay neurodegeneration.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disease of still poorly understood molecular etiology. Extensive studies at different molecular levels point to a high complexity of numerous interrelated pathways as the underpinnings of depression. Major systems under consideration include monoamines, stress, neurotrophins and neurogenesis, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, mitochondrial dysfunction, (epi)genetics, inflammation, the opioid system, myelination, and the gut-brain axis, among others. This review aims at illustrating how these multiple signaling pathways and systems may interact to provide a more comprehensive view of MDD’s neurobiology. In particular, considering the pattern of synaptic activity as the closest physical representation of mood, emotion, and conscience we can conceptualize, each pathway or molecular system will be scrutinized for links to synaptic neurotransmission. Models of the neurobiology of MDD will be discussed as well as future actions to improve the understanding of the disease and treatment options.","BACKGROUND Advances in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in oncology have significantly increased the chance of survival of cancer patients, even those with metastatic disease. However, cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is frequently reported in patients treated for non-central nervous system cancers, particularly during and after chemotherapy. DESIGN This review provides an update of the state of the art based on PubMed searches between 2012 and March 2019 on ""cognition"", ""cancer"", ""antineoplastic agents"" or ""chemotherapy"". It includes the most recent clinical, imaging and pre-clinical data and reports management strategies of CRCI. RESULTS Evidence obtained primarily from studies on breast cancer patients highlight memory, processing speed, attention, and executive functions as the most cognitive domains impaired post-chemotherapy. Recent investigations established that other cancer treatments, such as hormone therapies and targeted therapies, can also induce cognitive deficits. Knowledge regarding predisposing factors, biological markers or brain functions associated with CRCI has improved. Factors such as age and genetic polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E, catechol-O-methyltransferase and BDNF may predispose individuals to a higher risk of cognitive impairment. Poor performance on neuropsychological tests were associated with volume reduction in grey matter, less connectivity and activation after chemotherapy. In animals, hippocampus-based memory and executive functions, mediated by the frontal lobes, were shown to be particularly susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy. It involves altered neurogenesis, mitochondrial dysfunction or brain cytokine response. An important next step is to identify strategies for managing cognitive difficulties, with primary studies to assess cognitive training and physical exercise regimens. CONCLUSIONS CRCI is not limited to chemotherapy. A multidisciplinary approach has improved our knowledge of the complex mechanisms involved. Nowadays, studies evaluating cognitive rehabilitation programs are encouraged to help patients cope with cognitive difficulties and improve quality of life during and after cancer.","Recent studies suggest that stress-induced atrophy and loss of hippocampal neurons may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of antidepressants on hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult rat, using the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a marker for dividing cells. Our studies demonstrate that chronic antidepressant treatment significantly increases the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus and hilus of the hippocampus. Administration of several different classes of antidepressant, but not non-antidepressant, agents was found to increase BrdU-labeled cell number, indicating that this is a common and selective action of antidepressants. In addition, upregulation of the number of BrdU-labeled cells is observed after chronic, but not acute, treatment, consistent with the time course for the therapeutic action of antidepressants. Additional studies demonstrated that antidepressant treatment increases the proliferation of hippocampal cells and that these new cells mature and become neurons, as determined by triple labeling for BrdU and neuronal- or glial-specific markers. These findings raise the possibility that increased cell proliferation and increased neuronal number may be a mechanism by which antidepressant treatment overcomes the stress-induced atrophy and loss of hippocampal neurons and may contribute to the therapeutic actions of antidepressant treatment.","Neuroticism is an important risk factor for psychiatric traits, including depression1, anxiety2,3, and schizophrenia4–6. At the time of analysis, previous genome-wide association studies7–12 (GWAS) reported 16 genomic loci associated to neuroticism10–12. Here we conducted a large GWAS meta-analysis (n = 449,484) of neuroticism and identified 136 independent genome-wide significant loci (124 new at the time of analysis), which implicate 599 genes. Functional follow-up analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of specific cell types, including dopaminergic neuroblasts (P = 3.49 × 10−8), medium spiny neurons (P = 4.23 × 10−8), and serotonergic neurons (P = 1.37 × 10−7). Gene set analyses implicated three specific pathways: neurogenesis (P = 4.43 × 10−9), behavioral response to cocaine processes (P = 1.84 × 10−7), and axon part (P = 5.26 × 10−8). We show that neuroticism’s genetic signal partly originates in two genetically distinguishable subclusters13 (‘depressed affect’ and ‘worry’), suggesting distinct causal mechanisms for subtypes of individuals. Mendelian randomization analysis showed unidirectional and bidirectional effects between neuroticism and multiple psychiatric traits. These results enhance neurobiological understanding of neuroticism and provide specific leads for functional follow-up experiments.A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for neuroticism identifies novel loci, pathways and potential drug targets. Further analysis implicates specific brain regions and evaluates genetic overlap with other neuropsychiatric traits.",16.5451187006219,Autoimmune Disease Treatment Innovations

This process has been linked to learning and memory, stress and exercise, and is thought to be altered in neurological disease. In humans, some studies have suggested that hundreds of new neurons are added to the adult dentate gyrus every day, whereas other studies find many fewer putative new neurons. Despite these discrepancies, it is generally believed that the adult human hippocampus continues to generate new neurons. Here we show that a defined population of progenitor cells does not coalesce in the subgranular zone during human fetal or postnatal development. We also find that the number of proliferating progenitors and young neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed by 7 and 13 years of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and healthy adults (18–77 years; n = 17 post-mortem samples from controls; n = 12 surgical resection samples from patients with epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus. In the monkey (Macaca mulatta) hippocampus, proliferation of neurons in the subgranular zone was found in early postnatal life, but this diminished during juvenile development as neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans. The early decline in hippocampal neurogenesis raises questions about how the function of the dentate gyrus differs between humans and other species in which adult hippocampal neurogenesis is preserved.","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a unique form of neural circuit plasticity that results in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus throughout life. Neurons that arise in adults (adult-born neurons) show heightened synaptic plasticity during their maturation and can account for up to ten per cent of the entire granule cell population. Moreover, levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis are increased by interventions that are associated with beneficial effects on cognition and mood, such as learning, environmental enrichment, exercise and chronic treatment with antidepressants. Together, these properties of adult neurogenesis indicate that this process could be harnessed to improve hippocampal functions. However, despite a substantial number of studies demonstrating that adult-born neurons are necessary for mediating specific cognitive functions, as well as some of the behavioural effects of antidepressants, it is unknown whether an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve cognition and mood. Here we show that inducible genetic expansion of the population of adult-born neurons through enhancing their survival improves performance in a specific cognitive task in which two similar contexts need to be distinguished. Mice with increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis show normal object recognition, spatial learning, contextual fear conditioning and extinction learning but are more efficient in differentiating between overlapping contextual representations, which is indicative of enhanced pattern separation. Furthermore, stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, when combined with an intervention such as voluntary exercise, produces a robust increase in exploratory behaviour. However, increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis alone does not produce a behavioural response like that induced by anxiolytic agents or antidepressants. Together, our findings suggest that strategies that are designed to increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis specifically, by targeting the cell death of adult-born neurons or by other mechanisms, may have therapeutic potential for reversing impairments in pattern separation and dentate gyrus dysfunction such as those seen during normal ageing.","Glucocorticoids are released in response to stressful experiences and serve many beneficial homeostatic functions. However, dysregulation of glucocorticoids is associated with cognitive impairments and depressive illness. In the hippocampus, a brain region densely populated with receptors for stress hormones, stress and glucocorticoids strongly inhibit adult neurogenesis. Decreased neurogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression, but direct evidence for this role is lacking. Here we show that adult-born hippocampal neurons are required for normal expression of the endocrine and behavioural components of the stress response. Using either transgenic or radiation methods to inhibit adult neurogenesis specifically, we find that glucocorticoid levels are slower to recover after moderate stress and are less suppressed by dexamethasone in neurogenesis-deficient mice than intact mice, consistent with a role for the hippocampus in regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Relative to controls, neurogenesis-deficient mice also showed increased food avoidance in a novel environment after acute stress, increased behavioural despair in the forced swim test, and decreased sucrose preference, a measure of anhedonia. These findings identify a small subset of neurons within the dentate gyrus that are critical for hippocampal negative control of the HPA axis and support a direct role for adult neurogenesis in depressive illness.","Aging causes changes in the hippocampus that may lead to cognitive decline in older adults. In young animals, exercise increases hippocampal neurogenesis and improves learning. We investigated whether voluntary wheel running would benefit mice that were sedentary until 19 months of age. Specifically, young and aged mice were housed with or without a running wheel and injected with bromodeoxyuridine or retrovirus to label newborn cells. After 1 month, learning was tested in the Morris water maze. Aged runners showed faster acquisition and better retention of the maze than age-matched controls. The decline in neurogenesis in aged mice was reversed to 50% of young control levels by running. Moreover, fine morphology of new neurons did not differ between young and aged runners, indicating that the initial maturation of newborn neurons was not affected by aging. Thus, voluntary exercise ameliorates some of the deleterious morphological and behavioral consequences of aging.","Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is highly regulated by a number of environmental and cell-intrinsic factors to adapt to environmental changes. Accumulating evidence suggests that adult-born neurons may play distinct physiological roles in hippocampus-dependent functions, such as memory encoding and mood regulation. In addition, several brain diseases, such as neurological diseases and mood disorders, have deleterious effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and some symptoms of those diseases can be partially explained by the dysregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we review a possible link between the physiological functions of adult-born neurons and their roles in pathological conditions.","Adult neurogenesis and Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology destroys neurons and synapses in the brain, leading to dementia.

Interestingly, such impairments can be ameliorated through systemic perturbations such as exercise. Here, using heterochronic parabiosis we show that blood-borne factors present in the systemic milieu can inhibit or promote adult neurogenesis in an age-dependent fashion in mice. Accordingly, exposing a young mouse to an old systemic environment or to plasma from old mice decreased synaptic plasticity, and impaired contextual fear conditioning and spatial learning and memory. We identify chemokines—including CCL11 (also known as eotaxin)—the plasma levels of which correlate with reduced neurogenesis in heterochronic parabionts and aged mice, and the levels of which are increased in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of healthy ageing humans. Lastly, increasing peripheral CCL11 chemokine levels in vivo in young mice decreased adult neurogenesis and impaired learning and memory. Together our data indicate that the decline in neurogenesis and cognitive impairments observed during ageing can be in part attributed to changes in blood-borne factors.","Hippocampus is the significant component of the limbic lobe, which is further subdivided into the dentate gyrus and parts of Cornu Ammonis. It is the crucial region for learning and memory; its sub-regions aid in the generation of episodic memory. However, the hippocampus is one of the brain areas affected by Alzheimer’s (AD). In the early stages of AD, the hippocampus shows rapid loss of its tissue, which is associated with the functional disconnection with other parts of the brain. In the progression of AD, atrophy of medial temporal and hippocampal regions are the structural markers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lack of sirtuin (SIRT) expression in the hippocampal neurons will impair cognitive function, including recent memory and spatial learning. Proliferation, differentiation, and migrations are the steps involved in adult neurogenesis. The microglia in the hippocampal region are more immunologically active than the other regions of the brain. Intrinsic factors like hormones, glia, and vascular nourishment are instrumental in the neural stem cell (NSC) functions by maintaining the brain’s microenvironment. Along with the intrinsic factors, many extrinsic factors like dietary intake and physical activity may also influence the NSCs. Hence, pro-neurogenic lifestyle could delay neurodegeneration.",25.1579243084762,Neurodegenerative Disease Research

In vivo, SVZ progeny migrate 3–8 mm to the olfactory bulb, where they form neurons. We show here that the SVZ of the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles in adult mice is composed of neuroblasts, glial cells, and a novel putative precursor cell. The topographical organization of these cells suggests how neurogenesis and migration are integrated in this region. Type A cells had the ultrastructure of migrating neuronal precursors. These cells were arranged as chains parallel to the walls of the ventricle and were polysialylated neural adhesion cell molecule- (PSA–NCAM), TuJ1- (β-tubulin), and nestin-positive but GFAP- and vimentin-negative. Chains of Type A cells were ensheathed by two ultrastructurally distinct astrocytes (Type B1 and B2) that were GFAP-, vimentin-, and nestin-positive but PSA–NCAM- and TuJ1-negative. Type A and B2 (but not B1) cells incorporated [3H]thymidine. The most actively dividing cell in the SVZ corresponded to Type C cells, which had immature ultrastructural characteristics and were nestin-positive but negative to the other markers. Type C cells formed focal clusters closely associated with chains of Type A cells. Whereas Type C cells were present throughout the SVZ, they were not found in the rostral migratory stream that links the SVZ with the olfactory bulb. These results suggest that chains of migrating neuroblasts in the SVZ may be derived from Type C cells. Our results provide a topographical model for the adult SVZ and should serve as a basis for the in vivo identification of stem cells in the adult mammalian brain.","Single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal the transcriptional state of cells, yet provides little insight into the upstream regulatory landscape associated with open or accessible chromatin regions. Joint profiling of accessible chromatin and RNA within the same cells would permit direct matching of transcriptional regulation to its outputs. Here, we describe droplet-based single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression sequencing (SNARE-seq), a method that can link a cell’s transcriptome with its accessible chromatin for sequencing at scale. Specifically, accessible sites are captured by Tn5 transposase in permeabilized nuclei to permit, within many droplets in parallel, DNA barcode tagging together with the mRNA molecules from the same cells. To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively. We reconstructed the transcriptome and epigenetic landscapes of major and rare cell types, uncovered lineage-specific accessible sites, especially for low-abundance cells, and connected the dynamics of promoter accessibility with transcription level during neurogenesis. SNARE-seq measures expression profiles and chromatin accessibility in the same cell.","The dentate granule cell layer of the rodent hippocampal formation has the distinctive property of ongoing neurogenesis that continues throughout adult life. In both human temporal lobe epilepsy and rodent models of limbic epilepsy, this same neuronal population undergoes extensive remodeling, including reorganization of mossy fibers, dispersion of the granule cell layer, and the appearance of granule cells in ectopic locations within the dentate gyrus. The mechanistic basis of these abnormalities, as well as their potential relationship to dentate granule cell neurogenesis, is unknown. We used a systemic chemoconvulsant model of temporal lobe epilepsy and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling to investigate the effects of prolonged seizures on dentate granule cell neurogenesis in adult rats, and to examine the contribution of newly differentiated dentate granule cells to the network changes seen in this model. Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus caused a dramatic and prolonged increase in cell proliferation in the dentate subgranular proliferative zone (SGZ), an area known to contain neuronal precursor cells. Colocalization of BrdU-immunolabeled cells with the neuron-specific markers turned on after division, 64 kDa, class III β-tubulin, or microtubule-associated protein-2 showed that the vast majority of these mitotically active cells differentiated into neurons in the granule cell layer. Newly generated dentate granule cells also appeared in ectopic locations in the hilus and inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, developing granule cells projected axons aberrantly to both the CA3 pyramidal cell region and the dentate inner molecular layer. Induction of hippocampal seizure activity by perforant path stimulation resulted in an increase in SGZ mitotic activity similar to that seen with pilocarpine administration. These observations indicate that prolonged seizure discharges stimulate dentate granule cell neurogenesis, and that hippocampal network plasticity associated with epileptogenesis may arise from aberrant connections formed by newly born dentate granule cells.","The hippocampus is one of the few areas of the rodent brain that continues to produce neurons postnatally. Neurogenesis reportedly persists in rats up to 11 months of age. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, the present study confirms that in the adult rat brain, neuronal progenitor cells divide at the border between the hilus and the granule cell layer (GCL). In adult rats, the progeny of these cells migrate into the GCL and express the neuronal markers NeuN and calbindin-D28k. However, neurogenesis was drastically reduced in aged rats. Six-to 27-month-old Fischer rats were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU to detect newborn cells in vivo and to follow their fate in the dentate gyrus. When killed 4–6 weeks after BrdU labeling, 12- to 27- month-old rats exhibited a significant decline in the density of BrdU- positive cells in the granule cell layer compared with 6-month-old controls. Decreased neurogenesis in aging rats was accompanied by reduced immunoreactivity for poly-sialylated neural cell adhesion molecule, a molecule that is involved in migration and process elongation of developing neurons. When animals were killed immediately (12 hr) after BrdU injection, significantly fewer labeled cells were observed in the GCL and adjacent subgranular zone of aged rats, indicative of a decrease in mitotic activity of neuronal precursor cells. The reduced proliferation was not attributable to a general aged- related metabolic impairment, because the density of BrdU-positive cells was not altered in other brain regions with known mitotic activity (e.g., hilus and lateral ventricle wall). The decline in neurogenesis that occurs throughout the lifespan of an animal can thus be related to a decreasing proliferation of granule cell precursors.","Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine originally identified almost 30 years ago as a B-cell differentiation factor, capable of inducing the maturation of B cells into antibody-producing cells. As with many other cytokines, it was soon realized that IL-6 was not a factor only involved in the immune response, but with many critical roles in major physiological systems including the nervous system. IL-6 is now known to participate in neurogenesis (influencing both neurons and glial cells), and in the response of mature neurons and glial cells in normal conditions and following a wide arrange of injury models. In many respects, IL-6 behaves in a neurotrophin-like fashion, and seemingly makes understandable why the cytokine family that it belongs to is known as neuropoietins. Its expression is affected in several of the main brain diseases, and animal models strongly suggest that IL-6 could have a role in the observed neuropathology and that therefore it is a clear target of strategic therapies.","Neurogenesis must be properly regulated to ensure that cell production does not exceed the requirements of the growing cerebral cortex, yet our understanding of mechanisms that restrain neuron production remains incomplete. We investigated the function of microglial cells in the developing cerebral cortex of prenatal and postnatal macaques and rats and show that microglia limit the production of cortical neurons by phagocytosing neural precursor cells. We show that microglia selectively colonize the cortical proliferative zones and phagocytose neural precursor cells as neurogenesis nears completion. We found that deactivating microglia in utero with tetracyclines or eliminating microglia from the fetal cerebral cortex with liposomal clodronate significantly increased the number of neural precursor cells, while activating microglia in utero through maternal immune activation significantly decreased the number of neural precursor cells. These data demonstrate that microglia play a fundamental role in regulating the size of the precursor cell pool in the developing cerebral cortex, expanding our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate cortical development. Furthermore, our data suggest that any factor that alters the number or activation state of microglia in utero can profoundly affect neural development and affect behavioral outcomes.","Here, for the first time, we test a novel hypothesis that systemic treatment of stroke with exosomes derived from multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) promote neurovascular remodeling and functional recovery after stroke in rats. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) followed by tail vein injection of 100 μg protein from MSC exosome precipitates or an equal volume of vehicle phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (n = 6/group) 24 hours later. Animals were killed at 28 days after stroke and histopathology and immunohistochemistry were employed to identify neurite remodeling, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis. Systemic administration of MSC-generated exosomes significantly improved functional recovery in stroke rats compared with PBS-treated controls. Axonal density and synaptophysin-positive areas were significantly increased along the ischemic boundary zone of the cortex and striatum in MCAo rats treated with exosomes compared with PBS control. Exosome treatment significantly increased the number of newly formed doublecortin (a marker of neuroblasts) and von Willebrand factor (a marker of endothelial cells) cells. Our results suggest that intravenous administration of cell-free MSC-generated exosomes post stroke improves functional recovery and enhances neurite remodeling, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis and represents a novel treatment for stroke.","Microglia modulate memories Synaptic reorganization and circuit rewiring leads to loss or weakening of connections between neurons and may result in the erasure of previously formed memories. Microglia eliminate excessive synapses in the developing brain and regulate the dynamics of synaptic connections between neurons throughout life. However, it is still unclear whether forgetting is related to microglia activity and how microglia regulate memory erasure in the adult brain. Wang et al. discovered that microglia eliminated synaptic components in the adult hippocampus and that depleting microglia or inhibiting phagocytosis of microglia prevented forgetting. Synapse elimination by microglia may thus lead to degradation of memory engrams and forgetting of previously learned contextual fear memory. Science, this issue p. 688 Elimination of synapses in the mouse brain by microglia mediates dissociation of engram cells and forgetting of previously learned memories. Synapses between engram cells are believed to be substrates for memory storage, and the weakening or loss of these synapses leads to the forgetting of related memories. We found engulfment of synaptic components by microglia in the hippocampi of healthy adult mice. Depletion of microglia or inhibition of microglial phagocytosis prevented forgetting and the dissociation of engram cells. By introducing CD55 to inhibit complement pathways, specifically in engram cells, we further demonstrated that microglia regulated forgetting in a complement- and activity-dependent manner. Additionally, microglia were involved in both neurogenesis-related and neurogenesis-unrelated memory degradation. Together, our findings revealed complement-dependent synapse elimination by microglia as a mechanism underlying the forgetting of remote memories.","Recent studies suggest that stress-induced atrophy and loss of hippocampal neurons may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of antidepressants on hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult rat, using the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a marker for dividing cells. Our studies demonstrate that chronic antidepressant treatment significantly increases the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus and hilus of the hippocampus. Administration of several different classes of antidepressant, but not non-antidepressant, agents was found to increase BrdU-labeled cell number, indicating that this is a common and selective action of antidepressants. In addition, upregulation of the number of BrdU-labeled cells is observed after chronic, but not acute, treatment, consistent with the time course for the therapeutic action of antidepressants. Additional studies demonstrated that antidepressant treatment increases the proliferation of hippocampal cells and that these new cells mature and become neurons, as determined by triple labeling for BrdU and neuronal- or glial-specific markers. These findings raise the possibility that increased cell proliferation and increased neuronal number may be a mechanism by which antidepressant treatment overcomes the stress-induced atrophy and loss of hippocampal neurons and may contribute to the therapeutic actions of antidepressant treatment.","Heterochromatin is characterized by dimethylated or trimethylated histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9me2 or H3K9me3, respectively) and is found at transposable elements, satellite repeats and genes, where it ensures their transcriptional silencing. The histone methyltransferases (HMTs) that methylate H3K9 — in mammals Suppressor of variegation 3–9 homologue 1 (SUV39H1), SUV39H2, SET domain bifurcated 1 (SETDB1), SETDB2, G9A and G9A-like protein (GLP) — and the ‘readers’ of H3K9me2 or H3K9me3 are highly conserved and show considerable redundancy. Despite their redundancy, genetic ablation or mistargeting of an individual H3K9 methyltransferase can correlate with impaired cell differentiation, loss of tissue identity, premature aging and/or cancer. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the roles of the known H3K9-specific HMTs in ensuring transcriptional homeostasis during tissue differentiation in mammals. We examine the effects of H3K9-methylation-dependent gene repression in haematopoiesis, muscle differentiation and neurogenesis in mammals, and compare them with mechanistic insights obtained from the study of model organisms, notably Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. In all these organisms, H3K9-specific HMTs have both unique and redundant roles that ensure the maintenance of tissue integrity by restricting the binding of transcription factors to lineage-specific promoters and enhancer elements. Histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9)-methylated heterochromatin ensures transcriptional silencing of repetitive elements and genes, and its deregulation leads to impaired cell and tissue identity, premature aging and cancer.

However, the past 15 yr have seen the emergence of the microbiota (the trillions of microorganisms within and on our bodies) as one of the key regulators of gut-brain function and has led to the appreciation of the importance of a distinct microbiota-gut-brain axis. This axis is gaining ever more traction in fields investigating the biological and physiological basis of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, age-related, and neurodegenerative disorders. The microbiota and the brain communicate with each other via various routes including the immune system, tryptophan metabolism, the vagus nerve and the enteric nervous system, involving microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, branched chain amino acids, and peptidoglycans. Many factors can influence microbiota composition in early life, including infection, mode of birth delivery, use of antibiotic medications, the nature of nutritional provision, environmental stressors, and host genetics. At the other extreme of life, microbial diversity diminishes with aging. Stress, in particular, can significantly impact the microbiota-gut-brain axis at all stages of life. Much recent work has implicated the gut microbiota in many conditions including autism, anxiety, obesity, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Animal models have been paramount in linking the regulation of fundamental neural processes, such as neurogenesis and myelination, to microbiome activation of microglia. Moreover, translational human studies are ongoing and will greatly enhance the field. Future studies will focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain axis and attempt to elucidate microbial-based intervention and therapeutic strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders.","BACKGROUND Advances in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in oncology have significantly increased the chance of survival of cancer patients, even those with metastatic disease. However, cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is frequently reported in patients treated for non-central nervous system cancers, particularly during and after chemotherapy. DESIGN This review provides an update of the state of the art based on PubMed searches between 2012 and March 2019 on ""cognition"", ""cancer"", ""antineoplastic agents"" or ""chemotherapy"". It includes the most recent clinical, imaging and pre-clinical data and reports management strategies of CRCI. RESULTS Evidence obtained primarily from studies on breast cancer patients highlight memory, processing speed, attention, and executive functions as the most cognitive domains impaired post-chemotherapy. Recent investigations established that other cancer treatments, such as hormone therapies and targeted therapies, can also induce cognitive deficits. Knowledge regarding predisposing factors, biological markers or brain functions associated with CRCI has improved. Factors such as age and genetic polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E, catechol-O-methyltransferase and BDNF may predispose individuals to a higher risk of cognitive impairment. Poor performance on neuropsychological tests were associated with volume reduction in grey matter, less connectivity and activation after chemotherapy. In animals, hippocampus-based memory and executive functions, mediated by the frontal lobes, were shown to be particularly susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy. It involves altered neurogenesis, mitochondrial dysfunction or brain cytokine response. An important next step is to identify strategies for managing cognitive difficulties, with primary studies to assess cognitive training and physical exercise regimens. CONCLUSIONS CRCI is not limited to chemotherapy. A multidisciplinary approach has improved our knowledge of the complex mechanisms involved. Nowadays, studies evaluating cognitive rehabilitation programs are encouraged to help patients cope with cognitive difficulties and improve quality of life during and after cancer.","Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury paradoxically occurs during reperfusion following ischemia, exacerbating the initial tissue damage. The limited understanding of the intricate mechanisms underlying I/R injury hinders the development of effective therapeutic interventions. The Wnt signaling pathway exhibits extensive crosstalk with various other pathways, forming a network system of signaling pathways involved in I/R injury. This review article elucidates the underlying mechanisms involved in Wnt signaling, as well as the complex interplay between Wnt and other pathways, including Notch, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B, transforming growth factor-β, nuclear factor kappa, bone morphogenetic protein, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor-Ca^2+-Activin A, Hippo-Yes-associated protein, toll-like receptor 4/toll-interleukine-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β, and hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor. In particular, we delve into their respective contributions to key pathological processes, including apoptosis, the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, cell hypertrophy, fibrosis, ferroptosis, neurogenesis, and blood-brain barrier damage during I/R injury. Our comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms involved in Wnt signaling during I/R reveals that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway promotes organ recovery, while activation of the non-canonical Wnt pathways exacerbates injury. Moreover, we explore novel therapeutic approaches based on these mechanistic findings, incorporating evidence from animal experiments, current standards, and clinical trials. The objective of this review is to provide deeper insights into the roles of Wnt and its crosstalk signaling pathways in I/R-mediated processes and organ dysfunction, to facilitate the development of innovative therapeutic agents for I/R injury.","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most distributed and extensively studied neurotrophins in the mammalian brain. BDNF signals through the tropomycin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and the low affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). BDNF plays an important role in proper growth, development, and plasticity of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses and through modulation of neuronal differentiation, it influences serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. BDNF acts as paracrine and autocrine factor, on both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic target sites. It is crucial in the transformation of synaptic activity into long-term synaptic memories. BDNF is considered an instructive mediator of functional and structural plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS), influencing dendritic spines and, at least in the hippocampus, the adult neurogenesis. Changes in the rate of adult neurogenesis and in spine density can influence several forms of learning and memory and can contribute to depression-like behaviors. The possible roles of BDNF in neuronal plasticity highlighted in this review focus on the effect of antidepressant therapies on BDNF-mediated plasticity. Moreover, we will review data that illustrate the role of BDNF as a potent protective factor that is able to confer protection against neurodegeneration, in particular in Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, we will give evidence of how the involvement of BDNF in the pathogenesis of brain glioblastoma has emerged, thus opening new avenues for the treatment of this deadly cancer.","Heterochromatin is characterized by dimethylated or trimethylated histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9me2 or H3K9me3, respectively) and is found at transposable elements, satellite repeats and genes, where it ensures their transcriptional silencing.

Extensive studies at different molecular levels point to a high complexity of numerous interrelated pathways as the underpinnings of depression. Major systems under consideration include monoamines, stress, neurotrophins and neurogenesis, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, mitochondrial dysfunction, (epi)genetics, inflammation, the opioid system, myelination, and the gut-brain axis, among others. This review aims at illustrating how these multiple signaling pathways and systems may interact to provide a more comprehensive view of MDD’s neurobiology. In particular, considering the pattern of synaptic activity as the closest physical representation of mood, emotion, and conscience we can conceptualize, each pathway or molecular system will be scrutinized for links to synaptic neurotransmission. Models of the neurobiology of MDD will be discussed as well as future actions to improve the understanding of the disease and treatment options.","In the central nervous system, ageing results in a precipitous decline in adult neural stem/progenitor cells and neurogenesis, with concomitant impairments in cognitive functions.

Together our data indicate that the decline in neurogenesis and cognitive impairments observed during ageing can be in part attributed to changes in blood-borne factors.","Some recent clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is a key factor that interacts with the three neurobiological correlates of major depressive disorder: depletion of brain serotonin, dysregulation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and alteration of the continuous production of adult‐generated neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. This review discusses the main players in brain immunity as well as how inflammation interacts with the above three mechanisms. It is reported that kynurenine (KYN) pathway alteration in favour of its excitotoxic component and HPA axis dysregulation have the common effect of increasing extracellular glutamate levels and glutamate neurotransmission, which can impact hippocampal neurogenesis. This pathophysiological cascade appears to be triggered or sustained and reinforced by any chronic inflammatory condition involving increased circulating markers of inflammation that are able to cross the blood–brain barrier and activate microglia; it can also be the consequence of primary brain neuroinflammation, such as in neurodegenerative disorders with early manifestations that are frequently depressive symptoms. Further recent data indicate that primary microglial activation may also result from a direct impact of chronic stress on vascular function. The intricated dynamic crosstalk between neuroinflammation and other relevant neurobiological correlates of depression add to evidence that neuroinflammation may be a key therapeutic target for future therapeutic strategies in major depressive disorder.","Neuroticism is an important risk factor for psychiatric traits, including depression1, anxiety2,3, and schizophrenia4–6. At the time of analysis, previous genome-wide association studies7–12 (GWAS) reported 16 genomic loci associated to neuroticism10–12. Here we conducted a large GWAS meta-analysis (n = 449,484) of neuroticism and identified 136 independent genome-wide significant loci (124 new at the time of analysis), which implicate 599 genes. Functional follow-up analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of specific cell types, including dopaminergic neuroblasts (P = 3.49 × 10−8), medium spiny neurons (P = 4.23 × 10−8), and serotonergic neurons (P = 1.37 × 10−7). Gene set analyses implicated three specific pathways: neurogenesis (P = 4.43 × 10−9), behavioral response to cocaine processes (P = 1.84 × 10−7), and axon part (P = 5.26 × 10−8). We show that neuroticism’s genetic signal partly originates in two genetically distinguishable subclusters13 (‘depressed affect’ and ‘worry’), suggesting distinct causal mechanisms for subtypes of individuals. Mendelian randomization analysis showed unidirectional and bidirectional effects between neuroticism and multiple psychiatric traits. These results enhance neurobiological understanding of neuroticism and provide specific leads for functional follow-up experiments.A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for neuroticism identifies novel loci, pathways and potential drug targets. Further analysis implicates specific brain regions and evaluates genetic overlap with other neuropsychiatric traits.","Hippocampus is the significant component of the limbic lobe, which is further subdivided into the dentate gyrus and parts of Cornu Ammonis.

Emerging evidence has indicated that altered neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus represents an early critical event in the course of AD. Although causal links have not been established, a variety of key molecules involved in AD pathogenesis have been shown to impact new neuron generation, either positively or negatively. From a functional point of view, hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in structural plasticity and network maintenance. Therefore, dysfunctional neurogenesis resulting from early subtle disease manifestations may in turn exacerbate neuronal vulnerability to AD and contribute to memory impairment, whereas enhanced neurogenesis may be a compensatory response and represent an endogenous brain repair mechanism. Here we review recent findings on alterations of neurogenesis associated with pathogenesis of AD, and we discuss the potential of neurogenesis-based diagnostics and therapeutic strategies for AD.","Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is highly regulated by a number of environmental and cell-intrinsic factors to adapt to environmental changes. Accumulating evidence suggests that adult-born neurons may play distinct physiological roles in hippocampus-dependent functions, such as memory encoding and mood regulation. In addition, several brain diseases, such as neurological diseases and mood disorders, have deleterious effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and some symptoms of those diseases can be partially explained by the dysregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we review a possible link between the physiological functions of adult-born neurons and their roles in pathological conditions.","Neuroticism is an important risk factor for psychiatric traits, including depression1, anxiety2,3, and schizophrenia4–6.

In the early stages of AD, the hippocampus shows rapid loss of its tissue, which is associated with the functional disconnection with other parts of the brain. In the progression of AD, atrophy of medial temporal and hippocampal regions are the structural markers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lack of sirtuin (SIRT) expression in the hippocampal neurons will impair cognitive function, including recent memory and spatial learning. Proliferation, differentiation, and migrations are the steps involved in adult neurogenesis. The microglia in the hippocampal region are more immunologically active than the other regions of the brain. Intrinsic factors like hormones, glia, and vascular nourishment are instrumental in the neural stem cell (NSC) functions by maintaining the brain’s microenvironment. Along with the intrinsic factors, many extrinsic factors like dietary intake and physical activity may also influence the NSCs. Hence, pro-neurogenic lifestyle could delay neurodegeneration.","Aging causes changes in the hippocampus that may lead to cognitive decline in older adults. In young animals, exercise increases hippocampal neurogenesis and improves learning. We investigated whether voluntary wheel running would benefit mice that were sedentary until 19 months of age. Specifically, young and aged mice were housed with or without a running wheel and injected with bromodeoxyuridine or retrovirus to label newborn cells. After 1 month, learning was tested in the Morris water maze. Aged runners showed faster acquisition and better retention of the maze than age-matched controls. The decline in neurogenesis in aged mice was reversed to 50% of young control levels by running. Moreover, fine morphology of new neurons did not differ between young and aged runners, indicating that the initial maturation of newborn neurons was not affected by aging. Thus, voluntary exercise ameliorates some of the deleterious morphological and behavioral consequences of aging.","Glucocorticoids are released in response to stressful experiences and serve many beneficial homeostatic functions. However, dysregulation of glucocorticoids is associated with cognitive impairments and depressive illness. In the hippocampus, a brain region densely populated with receptors for stress hormones, stress and glucocorticoids strongly inhibit adult neurogenesis. Decreased neurogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression, but direct evidence for this role is lacking. Here we show that adult-born hippocampal neurons are required for normal expression of the endocrine and behavioural components of the stress response. Using either transgenic or radiation methods to inhibit adult neurogenesis specifically, we find that glucocorticoid levels are slower to recover after moderate stress and are less suppressed by dexamethasone in neurogenesis-deficient mice than intact mice, consistent with a role for the hippocampus in regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Relative to controls, neurogenesis-deficient mice also showed increased food avoidance in a novel environment after acute stress, increased behavioural despair in the forced swim test, and decreased sucrose preference, a measure of anhedonia. These findings identify a small subset of neurons within the dentate gyrus that are critical for hippocampal negative control of the HPA axis and support a direct role for adult neurogenesis in depressive illness.","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most distributed and extensively studied neurotrophins in the mammalian brain. BDNF signals through the tropomycin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and the low affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). BDNF plays an important role in proper growth, development, and plasticity of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses and through modulation of neuronal differentiation, it influences serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. BDNF acts as paracrine and autocrine factor, on both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic target sites. It is crucial in the transformation of synaptic activity into long-term synaptic memories. BDNF is considered an instructive mediator of functional and structural plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS), influencing dendritic spines and, at least in the hippocampus, the adult neurogenesis. Changes in the rate of adult neurogenesis and in spine density can influence several forms of learning and memory and can contribute to depression-like behaviors. The possible roles of BDNF in neuronal plasticity highlighted in this review focus on the effect of antidepressant therapies on BDNF-mediated plasticity. Moreover, we will review data that illustrate the role of BDNF as a potent protective factor that is able to confer protection against neurodegeneration, in particular in Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, we will give evidence of how the involvement of BDNF in the pathogenesis of brain glioblastoma has emerged, thus opening new avenues for the treatment of this deadly cancer.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disease of still poorly understood molecular etiology. Extensive studies at different molecular levels point to a high complexity of numerous interrelated pathways as the underpinnings of depression. Major systems under consideration include monoamines, stress, neurotrophins and neurogenesis, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, mitochondrial dysfunction, (epi)genetics, inflammation, the opioid system, myelination, and the gut-brain axis, among others. This review aims at illustrating how these multiple signaling pathways and systems may interact to provide a more comprehensive view of MDD’s neurobiology. In particular, considering the pattern of synaptic activity as the closest physical representation of mood, emotion, and conscience we can conceptualize, each pathway or molecular system will be scrutinized for links to synaptic neurotransmission. Models of the neurobiology of MDD will be discussed as well as future actions to improve the understanding of the disease and treatment options.","Adult neurogenesis and Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology destroys neurons and synapses in the brain, leading to dementia. The brain generates new neurons throughout life in the hippocampus, a process called adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Choi et al. found that blocking AHN exacerbated cognitive impairment in an AD mouse model (see the Perspective by Spires-Jones and Ritchie). Inducing neurogenesis alone did not improve cognition in AD mice, whereas inducing neurogenesis while simultaneously ameliorating the neuronal environment via exercise did. The use of genetic or pharmacological treatments that simultaneously induced neurogenesis and increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mimicked the benefits of exercise on cognition. Thus, inducing both neurogenesis and providing BDNF may be useful as an AD therapeutic. Science, this issue p. eaan8821; see also p. 975 Adult neurogenesis plays a critical role in neurodegeneration and cognition in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. INTRODUCTION Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia, characterized by cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and neuroinflammation. The most popular therapeutic approach aimed at reducing Aβ burden has not yet proved effective in halting disease progression. A successful therapy would both remove the pathological hallmarks of the disease and provide some functional recovery. The hippocampus contains neural progenitor cells that continue to generate new neurons, a process called adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). AHN is impaired before the onset of classical AD pathology in AD mouse models. Human AHN has also been reported to be altered in AD patients. However, evidence supporting a role for AHN in AD has remained sparse and inconclusive. RATIONALE Two fundamental questions remain: (i) whether AHN could be enhanced and exploited for therapeutic purposes for AD, and (ii) whether AHN impairment mediates aspects of AD pathogenesis. To address these questions, we increased AHN genetically (WNT3) and pharmacologically (P7C3) in AD transgenic 5×FAD mice and explored whether promoting AHN alone can ameliorate AD pathology and behavioral symptoms. We assessed the role of exercise, a known neurogenic stimulus, and explored whether promoting AHN in conjunction with the salutary biochemical changes induced by exercise can improve AD pathology and behavioral symptoms in mice. We also investigated whether AHN suppression, by irradiation, temozolomide, or dominant-negative WNT, contributes to AD pathogenesis and assessed the functional roles of AHN in AD. RESULTS Inducing AHN alone conferred minimal to no benefit for improving cognition in 5×FAD mice. Exercise-induced AHN improved cognition along with reduced Aβ load and increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), fibronectin type III domain–containing protein–5 (FNDC5), and synaptic markers. However, AHN activation was also required for exercise-induced improvement in memory. Inducing AHN genetically and pharmacologically in combination with elevating BDNF levels mimicked beneficial effects of exercise on AD mice. Conversely, suppressing AHN in early stages of AD exacerbated neuronal vulnerability in later stages of AD, leading to cognitive impairment and increased neuronal loss. However, no such effects from AHN ablation were observed in nontransgenic wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting that AHN has a specific role in AD. CONCLUSION Promoting AHN can only ameliorate AD pathology and cognitive deficits in the presence of a healthier, improved local brain environment, e.g., stimulated by exercise. Increasing AHN alone combined with overexpression of BDNF could mimic exercise-induced improvements in cognition, without reducing Aβ burden. Adult-born neurons generated very early in life are critical for maintaining hippocampal neuronal populations in the hostile brain environment created by AD later in life. Thus, AHN impairment may be a primary event that later mediates other aspects of AD pathogenesis. Future attempts to create pharmacological mimetics of the benefits of exercise on both increased AHN and BDNF may someday provide an effective means for improving cognition in AD. Moreover, increasing neurogenesis in the earliest stages of AD pathogenesis may protect against neuronal cell death later in the disease, providing a potentially powerful disease-modifying treatment strategy for AD. Role of adult-born neurons in AD. Inducing AHN alone by WNT3 and P7C3 together did not prevent cognitive dysfunction, whereas activating AHN through exercise improved memory in 5×FAD mice. Increasing AHN alone together with overexpression of BDNF could mimic exercise-induced improvement in cognition. Suppressing AHN exacerbated neuronal vulnerability, leading to cognitive impairment and increased neuronal loss in 5×FAD mice, but not in WT mice. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is impaired before the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. We found that exercise provided cognitive benefit to 5×FAD mice, a mouse model of AD, by inducing AHN and elevating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Neither stimulation of AHN alone, nor exercise, in the absence of increased AHN, ameliorated cognition. We successfully mimicked the beneficial effects of exercise on AD mice by genetically and pharmacologically inducing AHN in combination with elevating BDNF levels. Suppressing AHN later led to worsened cognitive performance and loss of preexisting dentate neurons. Thus, pharmacological mimetics of exercise, enhancing AHN and elevating BDNF levels, may improve cognition in AD. Furthermore, applied at early stages of AD, these mimetics may protect against subsequent neuronal cell death.",18.9172375957013,Wearable Cardiac Monitoring
