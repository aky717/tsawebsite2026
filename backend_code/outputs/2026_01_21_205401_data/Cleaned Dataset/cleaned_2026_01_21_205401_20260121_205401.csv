This review provides an overview of cellular and physiological mechanisms in plant responses to salt. We place cellular responses in a time- and tissue-dependent context in order to link them to observed phases in growth rate that occur in response to stress. Recent advances in phenotyping can now functionally or genetically link cellular signaling responses, ion transport, water management, and gene expression to growth, development, and survival. Halophytes, which are naturally salt-tolerant plants, are highlighted as success stories to learn from. We emphasize that (a) filling the major knowledge gaps in salt-induced signaling pathways, (b) increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of our knowledge of salt stress responses, (c) discovering and considering crop-specific responses, and (d) including halophytes in our comparative studies are all essential in order to take our approaches to increasing crop yields in saline soils to the next level.

Likewise, genes responsible for plant traits can be identified and altered quickly, transforming the pace of agricultural research and plant breeding. In this Review, we discuss the current state of CRISPR-mediated genetic manipulation in human cells, animals, and plants along with relevant successes and challenges and present a roadmap for the future of this technology. Description A decade of CRISPR In the decade since the publication of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome-editing technology, the CRISPR toolbox and its applications have profoundly changed basic and applied biological research. Wang and Doudna now review the origins and utility of CRISPR-based genome editing, the successes and current limitations of the technology, and where innovation and engineering are needed. The authors describe important advances in the development of CRISPR genome-editing technology and make predictions about where the field is headed. They also highlight specific examples in medicine and agriculture that show how CRISPR is already affecting society, with exciting opportunities for the future. —DJ A review discusses the current state of CRISPR-mediated genetic manipulation in human cells, animals, and plants and considers its future potential. BACKGROUND The fields of molecular biology, genetics, and genomics are at a critical juncture—a moment in history when a convergence of knowledge and methods has made it both technically possible and incredibly useful to edit specific base pairs or segments of DNA in cells and living organisms. The advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) genome editing, coupled with advances in computing and imaging capabilities, has initiated a new era in which we can not only diagnose human diseases and even predict individual susceptibility based on personal genetics but also act on that information. Likewise, we can both identify and rapidly alter genes responsible for plant traits, transforming the pace of agricultural research and plant breeding. The applications of this technology convergence are profound and far reaching—and they are happening now. In the decade since the publication of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome editing technology, the CRISPR toolbox and its applications have profoundly changed biological research, impacting not only patients with genetic diseases but also agricultural practices and products. As a specific example from the field of genomic medicine, it has become feasible to obtain a complete sequence of the human genome in less than 24 hours—a staggering advance considering the first such sequence took 5 years to generate. Notably, designing and putting to use a potent CRISPR genome editor to obtain clinically actionable information from that genome—previously a near-intractable challenge—now takes only a matter of days. For additional background and related topics, we refer readers to in-depth reviews of the microbiology and structural biology of CRISPR systems and to articles about the considerable ethical and societal challenges of this technology. ADVANCES The past decade has witnessed the discovery, engineering, and deployment of RNA-programmed genome editors across many applications. By leveraging CRISPR-Cas9’s most fundamental activity to create a targeted genetic disruption in a gene or gene regulatory element, scientists have built successful platforms for the rapid creation of knockout mice and other animal models, genetic screening, and multiplexed editing. Beyond traditional CRISPR-Cas9–induced knockouts, base editing—a technology utilizing engineered Cas9’s fused to enzymes that alter the chemical nature of DNA bases—has also provided a highly useful strategy to generate site-specific and precise point mutations. Over the past decade, scientists have utilized CRISPR technology as a readily adaptable tool to probe biological function, dissect genetic interactions, and inform strategies to combat human diseases and engineer crops. This Review covers the origins and successes of CRISPR-based genome editing and discusses the most pressing challenges, which include improving editing accuracy and precision, implementing strategies for precise programmable genetic sequence insertions, improving targeted delivery of CRISPR editors, and increasing access and affordability. We examine current efforts addressing these challenges, including emerging gene insertion technologies and new delivery modalities, and describe where further innovation and engineering are needed. CRISPR genome editors are already being deployed in medicine and agriculture, and this Review highlights key examples, including a CRISPR-based therapy treating sickle cell disease, a more nutritious CRISPR-edited tomato, and a high-yield, disease-resistant CRISPR-edited wheat, to illustrate CRISPR’s current and potential future impacts in society. OUTLOOK In the decade ahead, genome editing research and applications will continue to expand and will intersect with advances in technologies, such as machine learning, live cell imaging, and sequencing. A combination of discovery and engineering will diversify and refine the CRISPR toolbox to combat current challenges and enable more wide-ranging applications in both fundamental and applied research. Just as during the advent of CRISPR genome editing, a combination of scientific curiosity and the desire to benefit society will drive the next decade of innovation in CRISPR technology. CRISPR: past, present, and future. The past decade of CRISPR technology has focused on building the platforms for generating gene knockouts, creating knockout mice and other animal models, genetic screening, and multiplexed editing. CRISPR’s applications in medicine and agriculture are already beginning and will serve as the focus for the next decade as society’s demands drive further innovation in CRISPR technology.",,

These polyploidization events may have had important consequences in plant evolution, in particular for species radiation and adaptation and for the modulation of functional capacities. Here we report a high-quality draft of the genome sequence of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) obtained from a highly homozygous genotype. The draft sequence of the grapevine genome is the fourth one produced so far for flowering plants, the second for a woody species and the first for a fruit crop (cultivated for both fruit and beverage). Grapevine was selected because of its important place in the cultural heritage of humanity beginning during the Neolithic period. Several large expansions of gene families with roles in aromatic features are observed. The grapevine genome has not undergone recent genome duplication, thus enabling the discovery of ancestral traits and features of the genetic organization of flowering plants. This analysis reveals the contribution of three ancestral genomes to the grapevine haploid content. This ancestral arrangement is common to many dicotyledonous plants but is absent from the genome of rice, which is a monocotyledon.

By assigning individuals to presumptive species, called operational taxonomic units (OTUs), these systems speed investigations into the patterning of biodiversity and enable studies that would otherwise be impossible. Although OTUs have conventionally been separated through their morphological divergence, DNA-based delineations are not only feasible, but have important advantages. OTU designation can be automated, data can be readily archived, and results can be easily compared among investigations. This study exploits these attributes to develop a persistent, species-level taxonomic registry for the animal kingdom based on the analysis of patterns of nucleotide variation in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. It begins by examining the correspondence between groups of specimens identified to a species through prior taxonomic work and those inferred from the analysis of COI sequence variation using one new (RESL) and four established (ABGD, CROP, GMYC, jMOTU) algorithms. It subsequently describes the implementation, and structural attributes of the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system. Aside from a pragmatic role in biodiversity assessments, BINs will aid revisionary taxonomy by flagging possible cases of synonymy, and by collating geographical information, descriptive metadata, and images for specimens that are likely to belong to the same species, even if it is undescribed. More than 274,000 BIN web pages are now available, creating a biodiversity resource that is positioned for rapid growth.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066213&type=printable,

Plant growth and development involve numerous biochemical reactions that are sensitive to temperature. Plant responses to HT vary with the degree and duration of HT and the plant type. HT is now a major concern for crop production and approaches for sustaining high yields of crop plants under HT stress are important agricultural goals. Plants possess a number of adaptive, avoidance, or acclimation mechanisms to cope with HT situations. In addition, major tolerance mechanisms that employ ion transporters, proteins, osmoprotectants, antioxidants, and other factors involved in signaling cascades and transcriptional control are activated to offset stress-induced biochemical and physiological alterations. Plant survival under HT stress depends on the ability to perceive the HT stimulus, generate and transmit the signal, and initiate appropriate physiological and biochemical changes.

Genetic gain by molecular breeding has been limited, partially because cassava is a highly heterozygous crop with a repetitive and difficult-to-assemble genome. Findings Here we demonstrate that Pacific Biosciences high-fidelity (HiFi) sequencing reads, in combination with the assembler hifiasm, produced genome assemblies at near complete haplotype resolution with higher continuity and accuracy compared to conventional long sequencing reads. We present 2 chromosome-scale haploid genomes phased with Hi-C technology for the diploid African cassava variety TME204. With consensus accuracy >QV46, contig N50 >18 Mb, BUSCO completeness of 99%, and 35k phased gene loci, it is the most accurate, continuous, complete, and haplotype-resolved cassava genome assembly so far. Ab initio gene prediction with RNA-seq data and Iso-Seq transcripts identified abundant novel gene loci, with enriched functionality related to chromatin organization, meristem development, and cell responses. During tissue development, differentially expressed transcripts of different haplotype origins were enriched for different functionality. In each tissue, 20–30% of transcripts showed allele-specific expression (ASE) differences. ASE bias was often tissue specific and inconsistent across different tissues. Direction-shifting was observed in <2% of the ASE transcripts. Despite high gene synteny, the HiFi genome assembly revealed extensive chromosome rearrangements and abundant intra-genomic and inter-genomic divergent sequences, with large structural variations mostly related to LTR retrotransposons. We use the reference-quality assemblies to build a cassava pan-genome and demonstrate its importance in representing the genetic diversity of cassava for downstream reference-guided omics analysis and breeding. Conclusions The phased and annotated chromosome pairs allow a systematic view of the heterozygous diploid genome organization in cassava with improved accuracy, completeness, and haplotype resolution. They will be a valuable resource for cassava breeding and research. Our study may also provide insights into developing cost-effective and efficient strategies for resolving complex genomes with high resolution, accuracy, and continuity.",https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gigascience/giac028/43028017/giac028.pdf,

Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) are synthesized to provide defensive functions and regulate defense signaling pathways to safeguard plants against herbivores. Herbivore injury initiates complex reactions which ultimately lead to synthesis and accumulation of PSMs. The biosynthesis of these metabolites is regulated by the interplay of signaling molecules comprising phytohormones. Plant volatile metabolites are released upon herbivore attack and are capable of directly inducing or priming hormonal defense signaling pathways. Secondary metabolites enable plants to quickly detect herbivore attacks and respond in a timely way in a rapidly changing scenario of pest and environment. Several studies have suggested that the potential for adaptation and/or resistance by insect herbivores to secondary metabolites is limited. These metabolites cause direct toxicity to insect pests, stimulate antixenosis mechanisms in plants to insect herbivores, and, by recruiting herbivore natural enemies, indirectly protect the plants. Herbivores adapt to secondary metabolites by the up/down regulation of sensory genes, and sequestration or detoxification of toxic metabolites. PSMs modulate multi-trophic interactions involving host plants, herbivores, natural enemies and pollinators. Although the role of secondary metabolites in plant-pollinator interplay has been little explored, several reports suggest that both plants and pollinators are mutually benefited. Molecular insights into the regulatory proteins and genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites will pave the way for the metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathway intermediates for improving plant tolerance to herbivores. This review throws light on the role of PSMs in modulating multi-trophic interactions, contributing to the knowledge of plant-herbivore interactions to enable their management in an eco-friendly and sustainable manner.",https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/5/2690/pdf?version=1646200273,

Proline, an important amino acid, plays an important role in maintaining the metabolism and growth of plants under abiotic stress conditions. Many insights indicate a positive relationship between proline accumulation and tolerance of plants to various abiotic stresses. Because of its metal chelator properties, it acts as a molecular chaperone, an antioxidative defence molecule that scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as having signalling behaviour to activate specific gene functions that are crucial for plant recovery from stresses. It also acts as an osmoprotectant, a potential source to acquire nitrogen as well as carbon, and plays a significant role in the flowering and development of plants. Overproduction of proline in plant cells contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis, water uptake, osmotic adjustment and redox balance to restore the cell structures and mitigate oxidative damage. Many reports reveal that transgenic plants, particularly those overexpressing genes tailored for proline accumulation, exhibit better adaptation to abiotic stresses. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive update on proline biosynthesis and accumulation in plants and its putative regulatory roles in mediating plant defence against abiotic stresses. Additionally, the current and future directions in research concerning manipulation of proline to induce gene functions that appear promising in genetics and genomics approaches to improve plant adaptive responses under changing climate conditions are also highlighted.",,

Therefore, many strategies have been used to produce abiotic stress tolerance crop plants, among them, abscisic acid (ABA) phytohormone engineering could be one of the methods of choice. ABA is an isoprenoid phytohormone, which regulates various physiological processes ranging from stomatal opening to protein storage and provides adaptation to many stresses like drought, salt, and cold stresses. ABA is also called an important messenger that acts as the signaling mediator for regulating the adaptive response of plants to different environmental stress conditions.

Salinity stress impacts many aspects of a plant’s physiology, making it difficult to study in toto. Instead, it is more tractable to dissect the plant’s response into traits that are hypothesized to be involved in the overall tolerance of the plant to salinity. Scope and conclusions We discuss how to quantify the impact of salinity on different traits, such as relative growth rate, water relations, transpiration, transpiration use efficiency, ionic relations, photosynthesis, senescence, yield and yield components. We also suggest some guidelines to assist with the selection of appropriate experimental systems, imposition of salinity stress, and obtaining and analysing relevant physiological data using appropriate indices. We illustrate how these indices can be used to identify relationships amongst the proposed traits to identify which traits are the most important contributors to salinity tolerance. Salinity tolerance is complex and involves many genes, but progress has been made in studying the mechanisms underlying a plant’s response to salinity. Nevertheless, several previous studies on salinity tolerance could have benefited from improved experimental design.

The specific gene family members critical for biosynthesis of key tea metabolites, monomeric galloylated catechins and theanine, are indicated and found to have evolved specifically for these functions in the tea plant lineage. Two whole-genome duplications, critical to gene family evolution for these two metabolites, are identified and dated, but are shown to account for less amplification than subsequent paralogous duplications. These studies lay the foundation for future research to understand and utilize the genes that determine tea quality and its diversity within tea germplasm. Tea, one of the world’s most important beverage crops, provides numerous secondary metabolites that account for its rich taste and health benefits. Here we present a high-quality sequence of the genome of tea, Camellia sinensis var. sinensis (CSS), using both Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies. At least 64% of the 3.1-Gb genome assembly consists of repetitive sequences, and the rest yields 33,932 high-confidence predictions of encoded proteins. Divergence between two major lineages, CSS and Camellia sinensis var. assamica (CSA), is calculated to ∼0.38 to 1.54 million years ago (Mya). Analysis of genic collinearity reveals that the tea genome is the product of two rounds of whole-genome duplications (WGDs) that occurred ∼30 to 40 and ∼90 to 100 Mya. We provide evidence that these WGD events, and subsequent paralogous duplications, had major impacts on the copy numbers of secondary metabolite genes, particularly genes critical to producing three key quality compounds: catechins, theanine, and caffeine. Analyses of transcriptome and phytochemistry data show that amplification and transcriptional divergence of genes encoding a large acyltransferase family and leucoanthocyanidin reductases are associated with the characteristic young leaf accumulation of monomeric galloylated catechins in tea, while functional divergence of a single member of the glutamine synthetase gene family yielded theanine synthetase. This genome sequence will facilitate understanding of tea genome evolution and tea metabolite pathways, and will promote germplasm utilization for breeding improved tea varieties.",https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/18/E4151.full.pdf,

However, because bread wheat's genome is a large hybrid mix of three separate subgenomes, it has been difficult to produce a high-quality reference sequence. Using recent advances in sequencing, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium presents an annotated reference genome with a detailed analysis of gene content among subgenomes and the structural organization for all the chromosomes. Examples of quantitative trait mapping and CRISPR-based genome modification show the potential for using this genome in agricultural research and breeding. Ramírez-González et al. exploited the fruits of this endeavor to identify tissue-specific biased gene expression and coexpression networks during development and exposure to stress. These resources will accelerate our understanding of the genetic basis of bread wheat. Science, this issue p. eaar7191; see also p. eaar6089 Expression profiling of homoeologs (pairs of genes united by polyploidy) across tissues reveals expression asymmetry along wheat chromosomes. INTRODUCTION Polyploidy, arising from whole-genome duplication or interspecific hybridization, is ubiquitous across the plant and fungal kingdoms. The presence of highly related genes in polyploids, referred to as homoeologs, has been proposed to confer adaptive plasticity—for example, through neofunctionalization of duplicated genes or tissue-specific expression. This plasticity has facilitated the domestication and adaptation of major polyploid crops (e.g., wheat, cotton, and coffee). However, despite its likely importance, we have a limited understanding of the effect of polyploidy on gene expression and the extent to which homoeologs are similar or different in their expression patterns across development and tissues. RATIONALE Bread wheat is a polyploid derived from the hybridizations between three distinct diploid species and is an informative system for analyzing the effects of recent polyploidy on gene expression. Understanding the coordination of homoeologs and identifying the mechanisms associated with these processes should help define strategies to improve trait biology in a crop that provides more than 20% of the protein and caloric intake of humans. RESULTS Here we leverage 850 wheat RNA-sequencing samples, alongside the annotated genome, to determine the similarities and differences between homoeolog expression across a range of tissues, developmental stages, and cultivars. On average, ~30% of wheat homoeolog triads (composed of A, B, and D genome copies) showed nonbalanced expression patterns, with higher or lower expression from a single homoeolog with respect to the other two. These differences between homoeologs were associated with epigenetic changes affecting DNA methylation and histone modifications. Although nonbalanced homoeolog expression could be partially predicted by expression in diploid ancestors, large changes in relative homoeolog expression were observed owing to polyploidization. Our results suggest that the transposable elements in promoters relate more closely to the variation in the relative expression of homoeologs across tissues than to a ubiquitous effect across all tissues. We found that homoeologs with the highest inter-tissue variation had promoters with more frequent transposable element insertions and more varied cis-regulatory elements than homoeologs that were stable across tissues. We also identified expression asymmetry along wheat chromosomes. Homoeologs with the largest inter-tissue, inter-cultivar, and coding sequence variation were most often located in the highly recombinogenic distal ends of chromosomes. These transcriptionally dynamic homoeologs are under more relaxed selection pressure, potentially representing the first steps toward functional innovation through neo- or subfunctionalization. We generated tissue- and stress-specific coexpression networks that reveal extensive coordination of homoeolog expression throughout development. These networks, alongside detailed gene expression atlases (www.wheat-expression.com and http://bar.utoronto.ca), lay the groundwork to identify candidate genes influencing agronomic traits in wheat. CONCLUSION This study provides detailed insights into the transcriptional landscape of bread wheat, an evolutionarily young polyploid. Our work shows that homoeolog expression patterns in bread wheat have been shaped by polyploidy and are associated with both epigenetic modifications and variation in transposable elements within promoters of homoeologous genes. The extensive datasets and analyses presented here provide a framework that can help researchers and breeders develop strategies to improve crops by manipulating individual or multiple homoeologs to modulate trait responses. Homoeolog expression patterns in polyploid wheat. Seventy percent of triads (A, B, and D homoeologs) show balanced expression among homoeologs and are ubiquitously expressed (left), whereas ~30% show nonbalanced expression and are more tissue-specific (right; symbolized by three exemplar tissues). Variation in promoter elements and nonsynonymous substitution rates distinguish between individual triads with stable relative expression across tissues and triads with more inter-tissue variation (tissue-dynamic triads). The coordinated expression of highly related homoeologous genes in polyploid species underlies the phenotypes of many of the world’s major crops. Here we combine extensive gene expression datasets to produce a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of homoeolog expression patterns in hexaploid bread wheat. Bias in homoeolog expression varies between tissues, with ~30% of wheat homoeologs showing nonbalanced expression. We found expression asymmetries along wheat chromosomes, with homoeologs showing the largest inter-tissue, inter-cultivar, and coding sequence variation, most often located in high-recombination distal ends of chromosomes. These transcriptionally dynamic genes potentially represent the first steps toward neo- or subfunctionalization of wheat homoeologs. Coexpression networks reveal extensive coordination of homoeologs throughout development and, alongside a detailed expression atlas, provide a framework to target candidate genes underpinning agronomic traits in wheat.",https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6403/eaar6089.full.pdf,

ABA triggers a variety of physiological processes such as stomatal closure, root system modulation, organizing soil microbial communities, activation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression, and metabolic alterations. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of ABA-mediated drought responses in plants is critical for ensuring crop yield and global food security.

Here we describe a draft genome sequence of Brassica oleracea, comparing it with that of its sister species B. rapa to reveal numerous chromosome rearrangements and asymmetrical gene loss in duplicated genomic blocks, asymmetrical amplification of transposable elements, differential gene co-retention for specific pathways and variation in gene expression, including alternative splicing, among a large number of paralogous and orthologous genes. Genes related to the production of anticancer phytochemicals and morphological variations illustrate consequences of genome duplication and gene divergence, imparting biochemical and morphological variation to B. oleracea. This study provides insights into Brassica genome evolution and will underpin research into the many important crops in this genus. Brassica oleracea is plant species comprising economically important vegetable crops. Here, the authors report the draft genome sequence of B. oleracea and, through a comparative analysis with the closely related B. rapa, reveal insights into Brassicaevolution and divergence of interspecific genomes and intraspecific subgenomes.",https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4930.pdf,

As the agent of the Irish potato famine in the mid-nineteenth century, P. infestans has had a tremendous effect on human history, resulting in famine and population displacement. To this day, it affects world agriculture by causing the most destructive disease of potato, the fourth largest food crop and a critical alternative to the major cereal crops for feeding the world’s population. Current annual worldwide potato crop losses due to late blight are conservatively estimated at $6.7 billion. Management of this devastating pathogen is challenged by its remarkable speed of adaptation to control strategies such as genetically resistant cultivars. Here we report the sequence of the P. infestans genome, which at ∼240 megabases (Mb) is by far the largest and most complex genome sequenced so far in the chromalveolates. Its expansion results from a proliferation of repetitive DNA accounting for ∼74% of the genome. Comparison with two other Phytophthora genomes showed rapid turnover and extensive expansion of specific families of secreted disease effector proteins, including many genes that are induced during infection or are predicted to have activities that alter host physiology. These fast-evolving effector genes are localized to highly dynamic and expanded regions of the P. infestans genome. This probably plays a crucial part in the rapid adaptability of the pathogen to host plants and underpins its evolutionary potential.",https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08358.pdf,

They have phytostimulatory properties that result in increased plant growth and yield parameters in several important crop plants. They have phytoelicitor activity as their components evoke defense responses in plants that contribute to resistance to several pests, diseases, and abiotic stresses including drought, salinity, and cold. This is often linked to the upregulation of important defense-related genes and pathways in the plant system, priming the plant defenses against future attacks. They also evoke phytohormonal responses due to their specific components and interaction with plant growth regulation. Treatment by seaweed extracts and products also causes significant changes in the microbiome components of soil and plant in support of sustainable plant growth. Seaweed extracts contain a plethora of substances which are mostly organic, but trace levels of inorganic nutrient elements are also present. Fractionation of seaweed extracts into their components and their respective bioassays, however, has not yielded favorable growth effects. Only the whole seaweed extracts have been consistently proven to be very effective, which highlights the role of multiple components and their complex interactive effects on plant growth processes. Since seaweed extracts are highly organic, they are ideally suited for organic farming and environmentally sensitive crop production. They are also very compatible with other crop inputs, paving the way for an integrated management approach geared towards sustainability. The current review discusses the growth and functional effects evoked by seaweed extracts and their modes and mechanisms of action in crop plants which are responsible for elicitor and phytostimulatory activities.

From the assembly of the genome of Thinopyrum elongatum, a wild relative of wheat used in breeding programs to improve cultivated wheat, Wang et al. cloned a gene that can address both problems (see the Perspective by Wulff and Jones). The encoded glutathione S-transferase detoxifies the trichothecene toxin and, when expressed in wheat, confers resistance to FHB. Science, this issue p. eaba5435; see also p. 822 A wild relative of cultivated wheat offers a gene that drives resistance to an agricultural headache. INTRODUCTION Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a fungal disease that devastates global wheat production, with losses of billions of dollars annually. Unlike foliar diseases, FHB occurs directly on wheat spikes (inflorescences). The infection lowers grain yield and also causes the grain to be contaminated by mycotoxins produced by the Fusarium pathogen, thus imposing health threats to humans and livestock. Although plant breeders have improved wheat resistance to FHB, the lack of wheat strains with stable FHB resistance has limited progress. RATIONALE Many genetic loci in wheat affect FHB resistance but most only have minor effects; only a few exhibit a stable major effect on resistance. Wheat relatives in the Triticeae tribe carry resistant genes to different diseases including FHB and thus can be alternative sources of FHB resistance for wheat breeding. Thinopyrum wheatgrass has been used as a source of beneficial genes transferable to wheat by distant hybridization breeding since the 1930s. Fhb7, a gene transferred from Thinopyrum to wheat, showed a stable large effect on FHB resistance. However, the lack of a Thinopyrum reference genome hampered gene cloning and marker development, delaying the use of Fhb7 in wheat breeding. Here, we cloned Fhb7 using a reference assembly that we generated for Th. elongatum and characterized its resistance mechanisms and evolutionary history. RESULTS Using sequence data from Th. elongatum, we assembled the Triticeae E reference genome with 44,474 high-confidence genes annotated. Using this reference, we genetically mapped Fhb7 and located it to a 245-kb genomic region. We determined a gene encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) as Fhb7 by virus-induced gene silencing and evaluated mutants and transgenic plants. We discovered that Fhb7 detoxifies pathogen-produced trichothecene toxins by conjugating a glutathione (GSH) unit onto the epoxide moieties of type A and B trichothecenes. Fhb7 GST homologs are absent in the plant kingdom, but one sequence showing ~97% identity with Fhb7 was found in endophytic fungi of an Epichloë species that establishes symbiosis with temperate grasses. This result suggests that Fhb7 might have been transferred from Epichloë to Th. elongatum through horizontal gene transfer. Finally, we demonstrated that Fhb7, when introgressed into diverse wheat backgrounds by distant hybridization, confers broad resistance to both FHB and crown rot without penalizing wheat yield. Our results suggest a source of Fusarium resistance for wheat improvement. CONCLUSION Th. elongatum carries biotic and abiotic resistance genes and is a useful resource for wheat breeding. The assembled Th. elongatum reference genome can aid identification and cloning of such genes for wheat improvement. Cloning of Fhb7 revealed that it encodes a GST that can detoxify trichothecene toxins. Thus, Fhb7 resistance differs from Fhb1 resistance, which depends on a reduction of pathogen growth in spikes, although both confer durable resistance. The ability of Fhb7 to detoxify multiple mycotoxins produced by various Fusarium species demonstrates its potential as a source of resistance to the various diseases for which Fusarium trichothecenes are virulence factors. The deployment of Fhb7 in commercial wheat cultivars could alleviate both the food safety issue for consumers and the yield loss problem for growers. Sequence homologies between fungal and plant Fhb7 suggested that horizontal gene transfer may help to shape plant genomes. Fhb7 confers FHB resistance by detoxifying trichothecenes. (A) Fhb7 in Th. elongatum genome likely came from an Epichloë fungus through horizontal gene transfer. Fhb7 drives FHB resistance when introgressed from Thinopyrum into wheat. (B) Fhb7 encodes a GST that detoxifies Fusarium-produced trichothecenes by conjugating GSH (blue) to the epoxy group (red). R1 to R5 refer to the variable groups in trichothecenes. Fusarium head blight (FHB), a fungal disease caused by Fusarium species that produce food toxins, currently devastates wheat production worldwide, yet few resistance resources have been discovered in wheat germplasm. Here, we cloned the FHB resistance gene Fhb7 by assembling the genome of Thinopyrum elongatum, a species used in wheat distant hybridization breeding. Fhb7 encodes a glutathione S-transferase (GST) and confers broad resistance to Fusarium species by detoxifying trichothecenes through de-epoxidation. Fhb7 GST homologs are absent in plants, and our evidence supports that Th. elongatum has gained Fhb7 through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from an endophytic Epichloë species. Fhb7 introgressions in wheat confers resistance to both FHB and crown rot in diverse wheat backgrounds without yield penalty, providing a solution for Fusarium resistance breeding.",,

Microbiome alterations induced by antibiotics can also indirectly affect health in the long-term. The mutualistic microbes in the human body interact with many physiological processes, and participate in the regulation of immune and metabolic homeostasis. Therefore, antibiotic exposure can alter many basic physiological equilibria, promoting long-term disease.

Here we describe the draft sequence of the M. truncatula euchromatin based on a recently completed BAC assembly supplemented with Illumina shotgun sequence, together capturing ∼94% of all M. truncatula genes. A whole-genome duplication (WGD) approximately 58 Myr ago had a major role in shaping the M. truncatula genome and thereby contributed to the evolution of endosymbiotic nitrogen fixation. Subsequent to the WGD, the M. truncatula genome experienced higher levels of rearrangement than two other sequenced legumes, Glycine max and Lotus japonicus.

However, the effectiveness of pesticides is threatened by the evolution of resistant pathogens, weeds and insect pests. Pesticides are mostly novel synthetic compounds, and yet target species are often able to evolve resistance soon after a new compound is introduced. Therefore, pesticide resistance provides an interesting case of rapid evolution under strong selective pressures, which can be used to address fundamental questions concerning the evolutionary origins of adaptations to novel conditions. We ask: (i) whether this adaptive potential originates mainly from de novo mutations or from standing variation; (ii) which pre‐existing traits could form the basis of resistance adaptations; and (iii) whether recurrence of resistance mechanisms among species results from interbreeding and horizontal gene transfer or from independent parallel evolution. We compare and contrast the three major pesticide groups: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Whilst resistance to these three agrochemical classes is to some extent united by the common evolutionary forces at play, there are also important differences. Fungicide resistance appears to evolve, in most cases, by de novo point mutations in the target‐site encoding genes; herbicide resistance often evolves through selection of polygenic metabolic resistance from standing variation; and insecticide resistance evolves through a combination of standing variation and de novo mutations in the target site or major metabolic resistance genes. This has practical implications for resistance risk assessment and management, and lessons learnt from pesticide resistance should be applied in the deployment of novel, non‐chemical pest‐control methods.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/brv.12440,
