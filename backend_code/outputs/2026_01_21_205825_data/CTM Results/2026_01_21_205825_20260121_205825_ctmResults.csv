These stressors disrupt the cellular protein and metabolic homeostasis, which, if not alleviated, can lead to dysfunction and cell death of retinal neurons. One primary cellular stress response is the highly conserved unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR acts through three main signaling pathways in an attempt to restore the protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by various means, including but not limited to, reducing protein translation, increasing protein-folding capacity, and promoting misfolded protein degradation. Moreover, recent work has identified a novel function of the UPR in regulation of cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function, disturbance of which contributes to neuronal degeneration and dysfunction. The role of the UPR in retinal neurons during aging and under disease conditions in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been explored over the past two decades. Each of the disease conditions and their corresponding animal models provide distinct challenges and unique opportunities to gain a better understanding of the role of the UPR in the maintenance of retinal health and function. We performed an extensive literature search on PubMed and Google Scholar using the following keywords: unfolded protein response, metabolism, ER stress, retinal degeneration, aging, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy. We summarize recent advances in understanding cellular stress response, in particular the UPR, in retinal diseases, highlighting the potential roles of UPR pathways in regulation of cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function in retinal neurons. Further, we provide perspective on the promise and challenges for targeting the UPR pathways as a new therapeutic approach in age- and disease-related retinal degeneration.","Background Chronic inflammation significantly contributes to photoreceptor death in blinding retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers that act as key proinflammatory factors. We recently found the first-generation BET inhibitor JQ1 alleviated sodium iodate-induced retinal degeneration by suppressing cGAS-STING innate immunity. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanism of dBET6, a proteolysis‑targeting chimera (PROTAC) small molecule that selectively degrades BET by the ubiquitin‒proteasome system, in light-induced retinal degeneration. Methods Mice were exposed to bright light to induce retinal degeneration, and the activation of cGAS-STING was determined by RNA-sequencing and molecular biology. Retinal function, morphology, photoreceptor viability and retinal inflammation were examined in the presence and absence of dBET6 treatment. Results Intraperitoneal injection of dBET6 led to the rapid degradation of BET protein in the retina without detectable toxicity. dBET6 improved retinal responsiveness and visual acuity after light damage (LD). dBET6 also repressed LD-induced retinal macrophages/microglia activation, Müller cell gliosis, photoreceptor death and retinal degeneration. Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing results revealed cGAS-STING components were expressed in retinal microglia. LD led to dramatic activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, whereas dBET6 suppressed LD-induced STING expression in reactive macrophages/microglia and the related inflammatory response. Conclusions This study indicates targeted degradation of BET by dBET6 exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting cGAS-STING in reactive retinal macrophages/microglia, and is expected to become a new strategy for treatment of retinal degeneration.","The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) functions as a quality-control organelle for protein homeostasis, or “proteostasis”. The protein quality control systems involve ER-associated degradation, protein chaperons, and autophagy. ER stress is activated when proteostasis is broken with an accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins in the ER. ER stress activates an adaptive unfolded protein response to restore proteostasis by initiating protein kinase R-like ER kinase, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol requiring enzyme 1. ER stress is multifaceted, and acts on aspects at the epigenetic level, including transcription and protein processing. Accumulated data indicates its key role in protein homeostasis and other diverse functions involved in various ocular diseases, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, achromatopsia, cataracts, ocular tumors, ocular surface diseases, and myopia. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms underlying the aforementioned ocular diseases from an ER stress perspective. Drugs (chemicals, neurotrophic factors, and nanoparticles), gene therapy, and stem cell therapy are used to treat ocular diseases by alleviating ER stress. We delineate the advancement of therapy targeting ER stress to provide new treatment strategies for ocular diseases.","Since its discovery, nerve growth factor (NGF) has long occupied a critical role in developmental and adult neuro-biology for its many important regulatory functions on the survival, growth and differentiation of nerve cells in the peripheral and central nervous system. NGF is the first discovered member of a family of neurotrophic factors, collectively indicated as neurotrophins, (which include brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3 and neurotrophin 4/5). NGF was discov-ered for its action on the survival and differentiation of selected populations of peripheral neurons. Since then, an enormous number of basic and human studies were undertaken to explore the role of purified NGF to prevent the death of NGF-receptive cells. These studies revealed that NGF possesses important therapeutic properties, after topical administration, on human cutaneous pressure ulcer, corneal ulcers, glaucoma, retinal maculopathy, Retinitis Pigmentosa and in pediatric optic gliomas and brain traumas. The aim of this review is to present our previous, recent and ongoing clinical studies on the ther-apeutic properties of NGF.","An imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and anti-oxidant capacity results in oxidative injury to cellular components and molecules, which in turn disturbs the homeostasis of cells and organs. Although retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a hereditary disease, non-genetic biological factors including oxidative stress also modulate or contribute to the disease progression. In animal models of RP, the degenerating retina exhibits marked oxidative damage in the nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, and anti-oxidant treatments substantially suppress photoreceptor cell death and microgliosis. Although the mechanisms by which oxidative stress mediates retinal degeneration have not been fully elucidated, our group has shown that oxidative DNA damage and its defense system are key regulators of microglial activation and photoreceptor degeneration in RP. In this review, we summarize the current evidence regarding oxidative stress in animal models and patients with RP. The clinical efficacy of anti-oxidant treatments for RP has not been fully established. Nevertheless, elucidating key biological processes that underlie oxidative damage in RP will be pivotal to understanding the pathology and developing a potent anti-oxidant strategy that targets specific cell types or molecules under oxidative stress.","Purpose Photoreceptor degeneration occurs in various retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, molecular mechanisms are not fully understood yet. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood retinal barrier (oBRB) and supplies glucose, oxygen and nutrients from the fenestrated choriocapillaris to photoreceptors for visual function. Therefore, RPE dysfunction leads to photoreceptor injury/death and progression of blinding eye diseases. This study aims to understand the role of the thioredoxin (Trx) and its reductase (TrxR) redox signaling in human RPE dysfunction and cell death mechanism(s) in an in vitro system. Methods A human RPE cell line (APRE-19) was cultured in DMEM/F12 medium and treated with auranofin (AF – 4 μM, an inhibitor of TrxR) for 4 and 24 h. Mitochondrial and lysosomal function, cellular oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activity were measured using cell assays, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds were tested for blocking AF effects on RPE damage. Cell death mechanisms (LDH release to culture media) were determined using necroptosis, ferroptosis and pyroptosis inhibitors. P < 0.05 was considered significant in statistical analysis. Results Auranofin causes mitochondrial dysfunction (Δψm↓ and ATP↓), oxidative stress (H2O2↑) and mitophagic flux to lysosomes. Furthermore, the lysosomal enzyme (cathepsin L) activity is reduced while that of pro-inflammatory caspase-1 (NLRP3 inflammasome) is enhanced in ARPE-19. These effects of AF on ARPE-19 are inhibited by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (5 mM, NAC) and significantly by a combination of SS31 (mitochondrial antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox and tranilast). AF also causes cell death as measured by cytosolic LDH release/leakage, which is not inhibited by either ferrostatin-1 or necrostatin-1 (ferroptosis and necroptosis inhibitors, respectively). Conversely, AF-induced LDH release is significantly reduced by MCC950 and Ac-YVAD-cmk (NLRP3 and Caspase-1 inhibitors, respectively), suggesting a pro-inflammatory cell death by pyroptosis. Conclusion The Trx/TrxR redox system is critical for RPE function and viability. We previously showed that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is strongly induced in DR inhibiting the Trx/TrxR system and RPE dysfunction. Therefore, our results suggest that the TXNIP-Trx-TrxR redox pathway may participate in RPE dysfunction in DR and other retinal neurodegenerative diseases.","The protection of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) injury plays an important role in the prevention of or in delaying the pathological progress of retinal degeneration diseases, like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. Oxidative stress has been identified as a major inducer of RPE injury, which eventually could lead to a loss of vision. Kaempferol is a natural flavonoid widely distributed in many edible plants, fruits, and traditional medicines and has been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities. The present study demonstrates that the total antioxidant capacity of kaempferol is approximately two times stronger than that of lutein which is also a natural antioxidant that is widely used in the prevention or treatment of AMD. Our data indicates that kaempferol protects human RPE cells (ARPE-19) from hydrogen peroxide- (H2O2-) induced oxidative cell damage and apoptosis through the signaling pathways involving Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3 molecules proofed by real-time PCR and Western blot results. Kaempferol also inhibits the upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression levels induced by H2O2 in ARPE-19 cells and affects the oxidation and antioxidant imbalanced system in ARPE-19 cells treated by H2O2 through the regulations of both the activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Furthermore, our in vivo experimental results show that in sodium iodate-induced retinal degeneration rat model, kaempferol could protect sodium iodate-induced pathological changes of retina tissue and retinal cells apoptosis as well as the upregulated VEGF protein expression in RPE cells. In summary, these novel findings demonstrate that kaempferol could protect oxidative stressed-human RPE cell damage through its antioxidant activity and antiapoptosis function, suggesting that kaempferol has a potential role in the prevention and therapeutic treatment of AMD or other retinal diseases mediated by oxidative stress.","Primary cilia are specialised sensory and developmental signalling devices extending from the surface of most eukaryotic cells. Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders (ciliopathies) such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), frequently affecting many physiological and developmental processes across multiple organs. Cilium formation, maintenance and function depend on intracellular transport systems such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dynein motors and regulated by the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) cargo-adaptor protein complex, or BBSome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis when most sensory neurons differentiate. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161 (FAM161A orthologue), CCDC-104 (CCDC104), and RPI-1 (RP1/RP1L1), which we confirm are cilium-localised in worms. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we uncover orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analyses of C. elegans RAB-28, recently associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. Whereas inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localisation, GTP-bound (activated) RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses reveal that whilst cilium structure, sensory function and IFT are seemingly normal in a rab-28 null allele, overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB-28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function. Collectively, our findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins, and unveil RAB28, a GTPase most closely related to the BBS protein RABL4/IFT27, as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.","RNA splicing enables the functional adaptation of cells to changing contexts. Impaired splicing has been associated with diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and cellular responses remain poorly understood. In this work, we report that deficiency of ubiquitin-specific protease 39 (USP39) in human cell lines, zebrafish larvae, and mice led to impaired spliceosome assembly and a cytotoxic splicing profile characterized by the use of cryptic 5' splice sites. Disruptive cryptic variants evaded messenger RNA (mRNA) surveillance pathways and were translated into misfolded proteins, which caused proteotoxic aggregates, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and, ultimately, cell death. The detrimental consequence of splicing-induced proteotoxicity could be mitigated by up-regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system and selective autophagy. Our findings provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of spliceosome-associated diseases.","Retinal degenerative diseases are a group of heterogeneous diseases that include age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). The progressive degeneration of the retinal neurons results in a severe deterioration of the visual function. Neuroinflammation is an early hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders of the retina including AMD, RP and DR. Microglial cells, key components of the retinal immune defense system, are activated in retinal degenerative diseases. In the microglia the interplay between the proinflammatory/classically activated or antiinflammatory/alternatively activated phenotypes is a complex dynamic process that occurs during the course of disease due to the different environmental signals related to pathophysiological conditions. In this regard, an adequate transition from the proinflammatory to the anti-inflammatory response is necessary to counteract retinal neurodegeneration and its subsequent damage that leads to the loss of visual function. Insulin like-growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has been considered as a pleiotropic factor in the retina under health or disease conditions and several effects of IGF-1 in retinal immune modulation have been described. In this review, we provide recent insights of inflammation as a common feature of retinal diseases (AMD, RP and RD) highlighting the role of microglia, exosomes and IGF-1 in this process.",14.9781412062241,Humanitarian Medical Response
2,mouse; mutation; gene; photoreceptor; system; show; rod; retinal; inherit; degeneration; treatment; genetic; disease; model; retinitis_pigmentosa,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are important mediators in the transduction pathways of rod and cone photoreceptors. Native CNG channels are heterotetramers composed of homologous A and B subunits. In heterologous expression systems, B subunits alone cannot form functional CNG channels, but they confer a number of channel properties when coexpressed with A subunits. To investigate the importance of the CNGB subunits in vivo, we deleted the CNGB1 gene in mice. In the absence of CNGB1, only trace amounts of the CNGA1 subunit were found on the rod outer segment. As a consequence, the vast majority of isolated rod photoreceptors in mice lacking CNGB1 (CNGB1-/-) failed to respond to light. In electroretinograms (ERGs), CNGB1-/- mice showed no rod-mediated responses. The rods also showed a slow-progressing degeneration caused by apoptotic death and concurred by retinal gliosis. Cones were primarily unaffected and showed normal ERG responses up to 6 months, but they started to degenerate in later stages. At the age of ∼1 year, CNGB1-/- animals were devoid of both rods and cones. Our results show that CNGB1 is a crucial determinant of native CNG channel targeting. As a result of the lack of rod CNG channels, CNGB1-/- mice develop a retinal degeneration that resembles human retinitis pigmentosa.","Massive parallel sequencing enables identification of numerous genetic variants in mutant organisms, but determining pathogenicity of any one mutation can be daunting. The most commonly studied preclinical model of retinitis pigmentosa called the ""rodless"" (rd1) mouse is homozygous for two mutations: a nonsense point mutation (Y347X) and an intronic insertion of a leukemia virus (Xmv-28). Distinguishing which mutation causes retinal degeneration is still under debate nearly a century after the discovery of this model organism. Here, we performed gene editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and demonstrated that the Y347X mutation is the causative variant of disease. Genome editing in the first generation produced animals that were mosaic for the corrected allele but still showed neurofunction preservation despite low repair frequencies. Furthermore, second-generation CRISPR-repaired mice showed an even more robust rescue and amelioration of the disease. This predicts excellent outcomes for gene editing in diseased human tissue, as Pde6b, the mutated gene in rd1 mice, has an orthologous intron-exon relationship comparable with the human PDE6B gene. Not only do these findings resolve the debate surrounding the source of neurodegeneration in the rd1 model, but they also provide the first example of homology-directed recombination-mediated gene correction in the visual system.","The next-generation gene editing tool, prime editing (PE), is adept at correcting point mutations precisely with high editing efficiency and rare off-target events and shows promising therapeutic value in treating hereditary diseases. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common type of inherited retinal dystrophy and is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal photoreceptors and, consequently, visual decline. To date, effective treatments for RP are lacking. Herein, a PE system is designed to target the PDE6B Y347X mutation in the rd1 mouse strain, a preclinical RP model. We screen and develop the PE system with epegRNA and RTΔRnH, which is delivered via dual-AAV in vivo with an editing efficiency of 26.47 ± 13.35%, with negligible off-target effects confirmed by AID-Seq and PE-tag. Treatment with the PE system in vivo greatly restores PDE6B protein expression and protects rod cells from degeneration. Mouse behavioural experiments also show that compared with no treatment, prime editing inhibits vision deterioration in littermate rd1 mice. This study provides a therapeutic opportunity for the use of PE to correct mutated RPs at the genomic level. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common type of inherited retinal dystrophy without effective treatments. Here, authors apply prime editing (PE) system to correct the point mutation in a preclinical RP mouse model. In vivo treatment achieves genome editing and restores mice vision.","An HDR-based Cas9/RecA system was developed to precisely correct the Pde6b mutation in rods of rd1 mice to restore their vision. Although Cas9-mediated genome editing has been widely used to engineer alleles in animal models of human inherited diseases, very few homology-directed repair (HDR)–based genetic editing systems have been established in postnatal mouse models for effective and lasting phenotypic rescue. Here, we developed an HDR-based Cas9/RecA system to precisely correct Pde6b mutation with increased HDR efficiency in postnatal rodless (rd1) mice, a retinitis pigmentosa (RP) mutant model characterized by photoreceptor degeneration and loss of vision. The Cas9/RecA system incorporated Cas9 endonuclease enzyme to generate double-strand breaks (DSBs) and bacterial recombinase A (RecA) to increase homologous recombination. Our data revealed that Cas9/RecA treatment significantly promoted the survival of both rod and cone photoreceptors, restored the expression of PDE6B in rod photoreceptors, and enhanced the visual functions of rd1 mice. Thus, this study provides a precise therapeutic strategy for RP and other genetic diseases.","Inherited retinopathies are devastating diseases that in most cases lack treatment options. Disease-modifying therapies that mitigate pathophysiology regardless of the underlying genetic lesion are desirable due to the diversity of mutations found in such diseases. We tested a systems pharmacology-based strategy that suppresses intracellular cAMP and Ca2+ activity via G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) modulation using tamsulosin, metoprolol, and bromocriptine coadministration. The treatment improves cone photoreceptor function and slows degeneration in Pde6βrd10 and RhoP23H/WT retinitis pigmentosa mice. Cone degeneration is modestly mitigated after a 7-month-long drug infusion in PDE6A-/- dogs. The treatment also improves rod pathway function in an Rpe65-/- mouse model of Leber congenital amaurosis but does not protect from cone degeneration. RNA-sequencing analyses indicate improved metabolic function in drug-treated Rpe65-/- and rd10 mice. Our data show that catecholaminergic GPCR drug combinations that modify second messenger levels via multiple receptor actions provide a potential disease-modifying therapy against retinal degeneration. This preclinical study demonstrates the potential of a drug repurposing strategy using the coadministration of tamsulosin, metoprolol, and bromocriptine to provide a mutation-agnostic therapy for inherited retinal degeneration.","The bacterial CRISPR/Cas system has proven to be an efficient tool for genetic manipulation in various organisms. Here we show the application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the human Rhodopsin (RHO) gene in a mouse model for autosomal dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa. We designed single or double sgRNAs to knock-down mutant RHO expression by targeting exon 1 of the RHO gene carrying the P23H dominant mutation. By delivering Cas9 and sgRNAs in a single plasmid we induced an efficient gene editing in vitro, in HeLa cells engineered to constitutively express the P23H mutant RHO allele. Similarly, after subretinal electroporation of the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid expressing two sgRNAs into P23H RHO transgenic mice, we scored specific gene editing as well as significant reduction of the mutant RHO protein. Successful in vivo application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system confirms its efficacy as a genetic engineering tool in photoreceptor cells.","The inherited retinal degenerations are typified by retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders that causes the destruction of photoreceptor cells, the retinal pigmented epithelium, and choroid. This group of blinding conditions affects over 1.5 million persons worldwide. Approximately 30–40% of human autosomal dominant (AD) RP is caused by dominantly inherited missense mutations in the rhodopsin gene. Here we show that P23H, the most frequent RP mutation in American patients, renders rhodopsin extremely prone to form high molecular weight oligomeric species in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. Aggregated P23H accumulates in aggresomes, which are pericentriolar inclusion bodies that require an intact microtubule cytoskeleton to form. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we observe that P23H aggregates in the cytoplasm even at extremely low expression levels. Our data show that the P23H mutation destabilizes the protein and targets it for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system. P23H is stabilized by proteasome inhibitors and by co-expression of a dominant negative form of ubiquitin. We show that expression of P23H, but not wild-type rhodopsin, results in a generalized impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system, suggesting a mechanism for photoreceptor degeneration that links RP to a broad class of neurodegenerative diseases.","Oxidative and nitrosative damage are major contributors to cone cell death in retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In this study, we explored the effects of augmenting components of the endogenous antioxidant defense system in models of RP, rd1, and rd10 mice. Unexpectedly, overexpression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in rd1 mice increased oxidative damage and accelerated cone cell death. With an elaborate mating scheme, genetically engineered rd10 mice with either inducible expression of SOD2, Catalase, or both in photoreceptor mitochondria were generated. Littermates with the same genetic background that did not have increased expression of SOD2 nor Catalase provided ideal controls. Coexpression of SOD2 and Catalase, but not either alone, significantly reduced oxidative damage in the retinas of postnatal day (P) 50 rd10 mice as measured by protein carbonyl content. Cone density was significantly greater in P50 rd10 mice with coexpression of SOD2 and Catalase together than rd10 mice that expressed SOD2 or Catalase alone, or expressed neither. Coexpression of SOD2 and Catalase in rd10 mice did not slow rod cell death. These data support the concept of bolstering the endogenous antioxidant defense system as a gene-based treatment strategy for RP, and also indicate that coexpression of multiple components may be needed.","Among the Brazilian population, the frequency rates of inherited retinal dystrophies and their causative genes are underreported. To increase the knowledge about these dystrophies in our population, we retrospectively studied the medical records of 1,246 Brazilian patients with hereditary retinopathies during 20 years of specialized outpatient clinic care. Of these patients, 559 had undergone at least one genetic test. In this cohort, the most prevalent dystrophies were non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (35%), Stargardt disease (21%), Leber congenital amaurosis (9%), and syndromic inherited retinal dystrophies (12%). Most patients had never undergone genetic testing (55%), and among the individuals with molecular test results, 28.4% had negative or inconclusive results compared to 71.6% with a conclusive molecular diagnosis. ABCA4 was the most frequent disease-causing gene, accounting for 20% of the positive cases. Pathogenic variants also occurred frequently in the CEP290, USH2A, CRB1, RPGR, and CHM genes. The relative frequency rates of different inherited retinal dystrophies in Brazil are similar to those found globally. Although mutations in more than 250 genes lead to hereditary retinopathies, only 66 genes were responsible for 70% of the cases, which indicated that smaller and cheaper gene panels can be just as effective and provide more affordable solutions for implementation by the Brazilian public health system.","Base editing technology is an ideal solution for treating pathogenic single-nucleotide variations (SNVs). No gene editing therapy has yet been approved for eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Here, we show, in the rd10 mouse model, which carries an SNV identified as an RP-causing mutation in human patients, that subretinal delivery of an optimized dual adeno-associated virus system containing the adenine base editor corrects the pathogenic SNV in the neuroretina with up to 49% efficiency. Light microscopy showed that a thick and robust outer nuclear layer (photoreceptors) was preserved in the treated area compared with the thin, degenerated outer nuclear layer without treatment. Substantial electroretinogram signals were detected in treated rd10 eyes, whereas control treated eyes showed minimal signals. The water maze experiment showed that the treatment substantially improved vision-guided behavior. Together, we construct and validate a translational therapeutic solution for the treatment of RP in humans. Our findings might accelerate the development of base-editing based gene therapies.",20.8876380495291,Autoimmune Disease Treatment Innovations
3,disease; retinal; system; ocular; include; retinitis; eye; therapy; visual; review; clinical; use; retina; retinitis_pigmentosa; pigmentosa,"Purpose Biomarkers for several eye and brain diseases are reviewed, where retinal oximetry may help confirm diagnosis or measure severity of disease. These include diabetic retinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and Alzheimer's disease. Methods Retinal oximetry is based on spectrophotometric fundus imaging and measures oxygen saturation in retinal arterioles and venules in a noninvasive, quick, safe manner. Retinal oximetry detects changes in oxygen metabolism, including those that result from ischemia or atrophy. Results In diabetic retinopathy, venous oxygen saturation increases and arteriovenous difference decreases. Both correlate with diabetic retinopathy severity as conventionally classified on fundus photographs. In CRVO, vein occlusion causes hypoxia, which is measured directly by retinal oximetry to confirm the diagnosis and measure severity. In both diseases, the change in oxygen levels is a consequence of disturbed blood flow with resulting tissue hypoxia and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. In atrophic diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and glaucoma, retinal oxygen consumption is reduced and this is detected by retinal oximetry. Retinal oximetry correlates with visual field damage and retinal atrophy. It is an objective metabolic measure of the degree of retinal atrophy. Finally, the retina is part of the central nervous system tissue and reflects central nervous system diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, a change in retinal oxygen metabolism has been discovered. Conclusions Retinal oximetry is a novel, noninvasive technology that opens the field of metabolic imaging of the retina. Biomarkers in metabolic, ischemic, and atrophic diseases of the retina and central nervous system have been discovered.","Aim Gonadal hormones are essential for reproductive function, but can act on neural and other organ systems, and are probably the cause of the large majority of known sex differences in function and disease. The aim of this review is to provide evidence for this hypothesis in relation to eye disorders and to retinopathies in particular. Methods Epidemiological studies and research articles were reviewed. Results Analysis of the biological basis for a relationship between eye diseases and hormones showed that estrogen, androgen, and progesterone receptors are present throughout the eye and that these steroids are locally produced in ocular tissues. Sex hormones can have a neuroprotective action on the retina and modulate ocular blood flow. There are differences between the male and the female retina; moreover, sex hormones can influence the development (or not) of certain disorders. For example, exposure to endogenous estrogens, depending on age at menarche and menopause and number of pregnancies, and exposure to exogenous estrogens, as in hormone replacement therapy and use of oral contraceptives, appear to protect against age-related macular degeneration (both drusenoid and neurovascular types), whereas exogenous testosterone therapy is a risk factor for central serous chorioretinopathy. Macular hole is more common among women than men, particularly in postmenopausal women probably owing to the sudden drop in estrogen production in later middle age. Progestin therapy appears to ameliorate the course of retinitis pigmentosa. Diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes, may be more common among men than women. Conclusion We observed a correlation between many retinopathies and sex, probably as a result of the protective effect some gonadal hormones may exert against the development of certain disorders. This may have ramifications for the use of hormone therapy in the treatment of eye disease and of retinal disorders in particular.","Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a non-invasive retinal imaging modality used in clinical practice to provide a density map of lipofuscin, the predominant ocular fluorophore, in the retinal pigment epithelium. Multiple commercially available imaging systems, including the fundus camera, the confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope, and the ultra-widefield imaging device, are available to the clinician. Each offers unique advantages for evaluating various retinal diseases. The clinical applications of FAF continue to expand. It is now an essential tool for evaluating age related macular degeneration, macular dystrophies, retinitis pigmentosa, white dot syndromes, retinal drug toxicities, and various other retinal disorders. FAF may detect abnormalities beyond those detected on funduscopic exam, fluorescein angiography, or optical coherence tomography, and can be used to elucidate disease pathogenesis, form genotype-phenotype correlations, diagnose and monitor disease, and evaluate novel therapies. Given its ease of use, non-invasive nature, and value in characterizing retinal disease, FAF enjoys increasing clinical relevance. This review summarizes common ocular fluorophores, imaging modalities, and FAF findings for a wide spectrum of retinal disorders.","Introduction: Ocular targeted therapy has enormously been advanced by implementation of new methods of drug delivery and targeting using implantable drug delivery systems (DDSs) or devices (DDDs), stimuli-responsive advanced biomaterials, multimodal nanomedicines, cell therapy modalities and medical bioMEMs. These technologies tackle several ocular diseases such as inflammation-based diseases (e.g., scleritis, keratitis, uveitis, iritis, conjunctivitis, chorioretinitis, choroiditis, retinitis, retinochoroiditis), ocular hypertension and neuropathy, age-related macular degeneration and mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) due to accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Such therapies appear to provide ultimate treatments, even though much more effective, yet biocompatible, noninvasive therapies are needed to control some disabling ocular diseases/disorders. Methods: In the current study, we have reviewed and discussed recent advancements on ocular targeted therapies. Results: On the ground that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of ophthalmic drugs need special techniques, most of ocular DDSs/devices developments have been designed to localized therapy within the eye. Application of advanced DDSs such as Subconjunctival insert/implants (e.g., latanoprost implant, Gamunex-C), episcleral implant (e.g., LX201), cationic emulsions (e.g., Cationorm™, Vekacia™, Cyclokat™), intac/punctal plug DDSs (latanoprost punctal plug delivery system, L-PPDS), and intravitreal implants (I-vitaion™, NT-501, NT- 503, MicroPump, Thethadur, IB-20089 Verisome™, Cortiject, DE-102, Retisert™, Iluvein™ and Ozurdex™) have significantly improved the treatment of ocular diseases. However, most of these DDSs/devices are applied invasively and even need surgical procedures. Of these, use of de novo technologies such as advanced stimuli-responsive nanomaterials, multimodal nanosystems (NSs)/nanoconjugates (NCs), biomacromolecualr scaffolds, and bioengineered cell therapies need to be further advanced to get better compliance and higher clinical impacts. Conclusion: Despite mankind successful battle on ocular diseases, our challenge will continue to battle the ocular disease that happen with aging. Yet, we need to understand the molecular aspects of eye diseases in a holistic way and develop ultimate treatment protocols preferably as non-invasive systems.","A retinal prosthesis, also known as a bionic eye, is a device that can be implanted to partially restore vision in patients with retinal diseases that have resulted in the loss of photoreceptors (e.g., age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa). Recently, there have been major breakthroughs in retinal prosthesis technology, with the creation of numerous types of implants, including epiretinal, subretinal, and suprachoroidal sensors. These devices can stimulate the remaining cells in the retina with electric signals to create a visual sensation. A literature review of the pre-clinical and clinical studies published between 2017 and 2023 is conducted. This narrative review delves into the retinal anatomy, physiology, pathology, and principles underlying electronic retinal prostheses. Engineering aspects are explored, including electrode–retina alignment, electrode size and material, charge density, resolution limits, spatial selectivity, and bidirectional closed-loop systems. This article also discusses clinical aspects, focusing on safety, adverse events, visual function, outcomes, and the importance of rehabilitation programs. Moreover, there is ongoing debate over whether implantable retinal devices still offer a promising approach for the treatment of retinal diseases, considering the recent emergence of cell-based and gene-based therapies as well as optogenetics. This review compares retinal prostheses with these alternative therapies, providing a balanced perspective on their advantages and limitations. The recent advancements in retinal prosthesis technology are also outlined, emphasizing progress in engineering and the outlook of retinal prostheses. While acknowledging the challenges and complexities of the technology, this article highlights the significant potential of retinal prostheses for vision restoration in individuals with retinal diseases and calls for continued research and development to refine and enhance their performance, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.","Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), including the retina. Similar to brain microglia, retinal microglia are responsible for retinal surveillance, rapidly responding to changes in the environment by altering morphotype and function. Microglia become activated in inflammatory responses in neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). When activated by stress stimuli, retinal microglia change their morphology and activity, with either beneficial or harmful consequences. In this review, we describe characteristics of CNS microglia, including those in the retina, with a focus on their morphology, activation states and function in health, ageing, MS and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa, to highlight their activity in disease. We also discuss contradictory findings in the literature and the potential ways of reducing inconsistencies in future by using standardised methodology, e.g., automated algorithms, to enable a more comprehensive understanding of this exciting area of research.","Macrophages form a crucial component of the innate immune system, and their activation is indispensable for various aspects of immune and inflammatory processes, tissue repair, and maintenance of the balance of the body's state. Macrophages are found in all ocular tissues, spanning from the front surface, including the cornea, to the posterior pole, represented by the choroid/sclera. The neural retina is also populated by specialised resident macrophages called microglia. The plasticity of microglia/macrophages allows them to adopt different activation states in response to changes in the tissue microenvironment. When exposed to various factors, microglia/macrophages polarise into distinct phenotypes, each exhibiting unique characteristics and roles. Furthermore, extensive research has indicated a close association between microglia/macrophage polarisation and the development and reversal of various intraocular diseases. The present article provides a review of the recent findings on the association between microglia/macrophage polarisation and ocular pathological processes (including autoimmune uveitis, optic neuritis, sympathetic ophthalmia, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, subretinal fibrosis, uveal melanoma, ischaemic optic neuropathy, retinopathy of prematurity and choroidal neovascularization). The paradoxical role of microglia/macrophage polarisation in retinopathy of prematurity is also discussed. Several studies have shown that microglia/macrophages are involved in the pathology of ocular diseases. However, it is required to further explore the relevant mechanisms and regulatory processes. The relationship between the functional diversity displayed by microglia/macrophage polarisation and intraocular diseases may provide a new direction for the treatment of intraocular diseases.","COVID‐19 is caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, a betacoronavirus that uses the angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐related carboxypeptidase (ACE2) receptor to gain entry into cells. ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in multiple organs, including the retina, an extension of the central nervous system. The ACE2 receptor is involved in the diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy. Additionally, coronaviruses cause ocular infections in animals, including retinitis, and optic neuritis.","Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a significant clinical concern in newborns, immunocompromised patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy. CMV infection affects many organs, such as the lungs, digestive organs, the central nerve system, and eyes. In addition, CMV infection sometimes occurs in immunocompetent individuals. CMV ocular diseases includes retinitis, corneal endotheliitis, and iridocyclitis. CMV retinitis often develops in infected newborns and immunocompromised patients. CMV corneal endotheliitis and iridocyclitis sometimes develop in immunocompetent individuals. Systemic infections and CMV ocular diseases often require systemic treatment in addition to topical treatment.","Retinal prosthesis technologies require that the visual system downstream of the retinal circuitry be capable of transmitting and elaborating visual signals. We studied the capability of plastic remodeling in late blind subjects implanted with the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis with psychophysics and functional MRI (fMRI). After surgery, six out of seven retinitis pigmentosa (RP) blind subjects were able to detect high-contrast stimuli using the prosthetic implant. However, direction discrimination to contrast modulated stimuli remained at chance level in all of them. No subject showed any improvement of contrast sensitivity in either eye when not using the Argus II. Before the implant, the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity in V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) was very weak or absent. Surprisingly, after prolonged use of Argus II, BOLD responses to visual input were enhanced. This is, to our knowledge, the first study tracking the neural changes of visual areas in patients after retinal implant, revealing a capacity to respond to restored visual input even after years of deprivation.",36.0875022549046,Clinical Trial Optimization

Eldred et al. studied organoids that recapitulate the development of the human retina and found that differentiation of cone cells into their tuned subtypes was regulated by thyroid hormone. Cones expressing short-wavelength (S) opsin developed first, and cones expressing long- and medium-wavelength (L/M) opsin developed later. The switch toward development of L/M cones depended on thyroid hormone signaling through the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor. Science, this issue p. eaau6348 Human retinal organoids offer an opportunity to study the pathways regulating development of color vision. INTRODUCTION Cone photoreceptors in the human retina enable daytime, color, and high-acuity vision. The three subtypes of human cones are defined by the visual pigment that they express: blue-opsin (short wavelength; S), green-opsin (medium wavelength; M), or red-opsin (long wavelength; L). Mutations that affect opsin expression or function cause various forms of color blindness and retinal degeneration. RATIONALE Our current understanding of the vertebrate eye has been derived primarily from the study of model organisms. We studied the human retina to understand the developmental mechanisms that generate the mosaic of mutually exclusive cone subtypes. Specification of human cones occurs in a two-step process. First, a decision occurs between S versus L/M cone fates. If the L/M fate is chosen, a subsequent choice is made between expression of L- or M-opsin. To determine the mechanism that controls the first decision between S and L/M cone fates, we studied human retinal organoids derived from stem cells. RESULTS We found that human organoids and retinas have similar distributions, gene expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. During development, S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones. This temporal switch from specification of S cones to generation of L/M cones is controlled by thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. In retinal organoids that lacked thyroid hormone receptor β (Thrβ), all cones developed into the S subtype. Thrβ binds with high affinity to triiodothyronine (T3), the more active form of TH, to regulate gene expression. We observed that addition of T3 early during development induced L/M fate in nearly all cones. Thus, TH signaling through Thrβ is necessary and sufficient to induce L/M cone fate and suppress S fate. TH exists largely in two states: thyroxine (T4), the most abundant circulating form of TH, and T3, which binds TH receptors with high affinity. We hypothesized that the retina itself could modulate TH levels to control subtype fates. We found that deiodinase 3 (DIO3), an enzyme that degrades both T3 and T4, was expressed early in organoid and retina development. Conversely, deiodinase 2 (DIO2), an enzyme that converts T4 to active T3, as well as TH carriers and transporters, were expressed later in development. Temporally dynamic expression of TH-degrading and -activating proteins supports a model in which the retina itself controls TH levels, ensuring low TH signaling early to specify S cones and high TH signaling later in development to produce L/M cones. CONCLUSION Studies of model organisms and human epidemiology often generate hypotheses about human biology that cannot be studied in humans. Organoids provide a system to determine the mechanisms of human development, enabling direct testing of hypotheses in developing human tissue. Our studies identify temporal regulation of TH signaling as a mechanism that controls cone subtype specification in humans. Consistent with our findings, preterm human infants with low T3 and T4 have an increased incidence of color vision defects. Moreover, our identification of a mechanism that generates one cone subtype while suppressing the other, coupled with successful transplantation and incorporation of stem cell–derived photoreceptors in mice, suggests that the promise of therapies to treat human diseases such as color blindness, retinitis pigmentosa, and macular degeneration will be achieved in the near future. Temporally regulated TH signaling specifies cone subtypes. (A) Embryonic stem cell–derived human retinal organoids [wild type (WT)] generate S and L/M cones. Blue, S-opsin; green, L/M-opsin. (B) Organoids that lack thyroid hormone receptor β (Thrβ KO) generate all S cones. (C) Early activation of TH signaling (WT + T3) specifies nearly all L/M cones. (D) TH-degrading enzymes (such as DIO3) expressed early in development lower TH and promote S fate, whereas TH-activating regulators (such as DIO2) expressed later promote L/M fate. The mechanisms underlying specification of neuronal subtypes within the human nervous system are largely unknown. The blue (S), green (M), and red (L) cones of the retina enable high-acuity daytime and color vision. To determine the mechanism that controls S versus L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human retinal organoids. Organoids and retinas have similar distributions, expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones, and thyroid hormone signaling controls this temporal switch. Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone–degrading and –activating proteins within the retina ensures low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones. This work establishes organoids as a model for determining mechanisms of human development with promising utility for therapeutics and vision repair.","Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinopathy that leads to photoreceptor loss. RP has been related to oxidative stress, autophagy, and inflammation. This study aimed to identify changes in the levels of oxidative stress and autophagy markers in the retina of control and rd10 mice during different phases of retinal development. Changes in the retinal oxidation system were investigated by measuring the levels of oxidized and reduced glutathione (GSH/GSSG), retinal avidin-positive cells, and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) staining intensity. Autophagy characterization was explored by measuring the levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), beclin, autophagy-related proteins 5 and 7 (Atg5 and Atg7), and lysosomal associated membrane protein-2A (LAMP-2A). At P28 retinal GSH concentrations decreased in rd10 mice compared to the controls. No differences were found in retinal GSSG concentrations between the control and rd10 mice. There was an increase in retinal GSSG concentrations and a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio in the control and rd10 mice at P21 and P28 compared to P13. We observed an increase in avidin-positive cells in rd10 retinas. 4-HNE was increased in rd10 retinas at P13, and it also increased in control mice with age. We did not observe any differences in the retinal levels of LC3II/I ratio, Beclin, Atg5, or Atg7 in the rd10 mice compared to the controls. There was an increase in the LAMP-2A concentrations in the control and rd10 mice with development age (P28 concentrations vs. P13). Although only slight differences were found in the oxidative stress and autophagy markers between the control and rd10 mice, there were increases in the GSSG, 4-HNE, and LAMP-2A with age. This increase in the oxidative stress and chaperone-mediated autophagy has not been described before and occurred just after the mice opened their eyes, potentially indicating a retinal response to light exposure.","Base editing technology is an ideal solution for treating pathogenic single-nucleotide variations (SNVs). No gene editing therapy has yet been approved for eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Here, we show, in the rd10 mouse model, which carries an SNV identified as an RP-causing mutation in human patients, that subretinal delivery of an optimized dual adeno-associated virus system containing the adenine base editor corrects the pathogenic SNV in the neuroretina with up to 49% efficiency. Light microscopy showed that a thick and robust outer nuclear layer (photoreceptors) was preserved in the treated area compared with the thin, degenerated outer nuclear layer without treatment. Substantial electroretinogram signals were detected in treated rd10 eyes, whereas control treated eyes showed minimal signals. The water maze experiment showed that the treatment substantially improved vision-guided behavior. Together, we construct and validate a translational therapeutic solution for the treatment of RP in humans. Our findings might accelerate the development of base-editing based gene therapies.","Although an increasing number of disease genes have been identified, the exact cellular mechanisms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) remain largely unclear. Retinal organoids (ROs) derived from the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of patients provide a potential but unvalidated platform for deciphering disease mechanisms and an advantageous tool for preclinical testing of new treatments. Notably, early-onset RP has been extensively recapitulated by patient-iPSC-derived ROs. However, it remains a challenge to model late-onset disease in a dish due to its chronicity, complexity, and instability. Here, we generated ROs from late-onset RP proband-derived iPSCs harboring a PDE6B mutation. Transcriptome analysis revealed a remarkably distinct gene expression profile in the patient ROs at differentiation day (D) 230. Changes in the expression genes regulating cGMP hydrolysis prompted the elevation of cGMP levels, which was verified by a cGMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in patient ROs. Furthermore, significantly higher cGMP levels in patient ROs than in control ROs at D193 and D230 might lead to impaired formation of synaptic connections and the connecting cilium in photoreceptor cells. In this study, we established the first late-onset RP model with a consistent phenotype using an in vitro cell culture system and provided new insights into the PDE6B-related mechanism of RP.","Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of genetic retinal disorders characterized by progressive vision loss, culminating in blindness. Identifying pigment signs (PS) linked with RP is crucial for monitoring and possibly slowing the disease’s degenerative course. However, the segmentation and detection of PS are challenging due to the difficulty of distinguishing between PS and blood vessels and the variability in size, shape, and color of PS. Recently, advances in deep learning techniques have shown impressive results in medical image analysis, especially in ophthalmology. This study presents an approach for classifying pigment marks in color fundus images of RP using a modified squeeze-and-excitation ResNet (SE-ResNet) architecture. This variant synergizes the efficiency of residual skip connections with the robust attention mechanism of the SE block to amplify feature representation. The SE-ResNet model was fine-tuned to determine the optimal layer configuration that balances performance metrics and computational costs. We trained the proposed model on the RIPS dataset, which comprises images from patients diagnosed at various RP stages. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed model in classifying different types of pigment signs associated with RP. The model yielded performance metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f-measure of 99.16%, 97.70%, 96.93%, 90.47%, 99.37%, 97.80%, 97.44%, and 90.60% on the testing set, based on GT1 & GT2 respectively. Given its performance, this model is an excellent candidate for integration into computer-aided diagnostic systems for RP, aiming to enhance patient care and vision-related healthcare services.","Lysophosphatidylserines (lyso-PSs) are a class of signaling lipids that regulate immunological and neurological processes. The metabolism of lyso-PSs remains poorly understood in vivo. Recently, we determined that ABHD12 is a major brain lyso-PS lipase, implicating lyso-PSs in the neurological disease polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and cataract (PHARC), which is caused by null mutations in the ABHD12 gene. Here, we couple activity-based profiling with pharmacological and genetic methods to annotate the poorly characterized enzyme ABHD16A as a phosphatidylserine (PS) lipase that generates lyso-PS in mammalian systems. We describe a small-molecule inhibitor of ABHD16A that depletes lyso-PSs from cells, including lymphoblasts derived from subjects with PHARC. In mouse macrophages, disruption of ABHD12 and ABHD16A respectively increases and decreases both lyso-PSs and lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production. Finally, Abhd16a(-/-) mice have decreased brain lyso-PSs, which runs counter to the elevation in lyso-PS in Abhd12(-/-) mice. Our findings illuminate an ABHD16A-ABHD12 axis that dynamically regulates lyso-PS metabolism in vivo, designating these enzymes as potential targets for treating neuroimmunological disorders.","Oxidative and nitrosative damage are major contributors to cone cell death in retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In this study, we explored the effects of augmenting components of the endogenous antioxidant defense system in models of RP, rd1, and rd10 mice. Unexpectedly, overexpression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in rd1 mice increased oxidative damage and accelerated cone cell death. With an elaborate mating scheme, genetically engineered rd10 mice with either inducible expression of SOD2, Catalase, or both in photoreceptor mitochondria were generated. Littermates with the same genetic background that did not have increased expression of SOD2 nor Catalase provided ideal controls. Coexpression of SOD2 and Catalase, but not either alone, significantly reduced oxidative damage in the retinas of postnatal day (P) 50 rd10 mice as measured by protein carbonyl content. Cone density was significantly greater in P50 rd10 mice with coexpression of SOD2 and Catalase together than rd10 mice that expressed SOD2 or Catalase alone, or expressed neither. Coexpression of SOD2 and Catalase in rd10 mice did not slow rod cell death. These data support the concept of bolstering the endogenous antioxidant defense system as a gene-based treatment strategy for RP, and also indicate that coexpression of multiple components may be needed.","P23H is the most common mutation in the RHODOPSIN (RHO) gene leading to a dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a rod photoreceptor degeneration that invariably causes vision loss. Specific disruption of the disease P23H RHO mutant while preserving the wild-type (WT) functional allele would be an invaluable therapy for this disease. However, various technologies tested in the past failed to achieve effective changes and consequently therapeutic benefits. We validated a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to specifically inactivate the P23H RHO mutant, while preserving the WT allele in vitro. We, then, translated this approach in vivo by delivering the CRISPR/Cas9 components in murine Rho+/P23H mutant retinae. Targeted retinae presented a high rate of cleavage in the P23H but not WT Rho allele. This gene manipulation was sufficient to slow photoreceptor degeneration and improve retinal functions. To improve the translational potential of our approach, we tested intravitreal delivery of this system by means of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). To this purpose, the employment of the AAV9-PHP.B resulted the most effective in disrupting the P23H Rho mutant. Finally, this approach was translated successfully in human cells engineered with the homozygous P23H RHO gene mutation. Overall, this is a significant proof-of-concept that gene allele specific targeting by CRISPR/Cas9 technology is specific and efficient and represents an unprecedented tool for treating RP and more broadly dominant genetic human disorders affecting the eye, as well as other tissues.","Abstract Delivery of drugs to special locations of ocular lesions, while minimizing systemic and local toxic effects, is recognized as a critical challenge in the ophthalmic practice. The special anatomy and physiology barriers within the eyeball entail effective drug delivery systems. Emerging attempts in drug delivery has led to developments in ocular iontophoresis, which acts as a noninvasive technology to enhance drug penetration using a small electric current. This technique offers greater flexibility to deliver desired drug dose in a controlled and tolerable manner. In previous studies, this technique has been testified to deliver antibiotics, corticoid, proteins and other gene drugs into the eye with the potency of treating or alleviating diverse ophthalmological diseases including uveitis, cataract, retinoblastoma, herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMVR), etc. In this review, we will introduce the recent developments in iontophoresis device. We also summarize the latest progress in coulomb controlled iontophoresis (CCI), hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC) and EyeGate II delivery system (EGDS), as well as overview the potential toxicity of iontophoresis. We will discuss these factors that affect the efficacy of iontophoresis experiments, and focus on the latest progress in its clinical application in the treatment of eye diseases.","Dysfunction or death of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is involved in some forms of Retinitis Pigmentosa and in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Since there is no cure for most patients affected by these diseases, the transplantation of RPE cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represents an attractive therapeutic alternative. First attempts to transplant hPSC-RPE cells in AMD and Stargardt patients demonstrated the safety and suggested the potential efficacy of this strategy. However, it also highlighted the need to upscale the production of the cells to be grafted in order to treat the millions of potential patients. Automated cell culture systems are necessary to change the scale of cell production. In the present study, we developed a protocol amenable for automation that combines in a sequential manner Nicotinamide, Activin A and CHIR99021 to direct the differentiation of hPSCs into RPE cells. This novel differentiation protocol associated with the use of cell culture robots open new possibilities for the production of large batches of hPSC-RPE cells while maintaining a high cell purity and functionality. Such methodology of cell culture automation could therefore be applied to various differentiation processes in order to generate the material suitable for cell therapy.",7.90902413323053,Infection Prevention and Control

We describe a whole-genome siRNA-based reverse genetics screen for defects in biogenesis and/or maintenance of the primary cilium, obtaining a global resource. We identify 112 candidate ciliogenesis and ciliopathy genes, including 44 components of the ubiquitin–proteasome system, 12 G-protein-coupled receptors, and 3 pre-mRNA processing factors (PRPF6, PRPF8 and PRPF31) mutated in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The PRPFs localize to the connecting cilium, and PRPF8- and PRPF31-mutated cells have ciliary defects. Combining the screen with exome sequencing data identified recessive mutations in PIBF1, also known as CEP90, and C21orf2, also known as LRRC76, as causes of the ciliopathies Joubert and Jeune syndromes. Biochemical approaches place C21orf2 within key ciliopathy-associated protein modules, offering an explanation for the skeletal and retinal involvement observed in individuals with C21orf2 variants. Our global, unbiased approaches provide insights into ciliogenesis complexity and identify roles for unanticipated pathways in human genetic disease.","Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of heterogeneous inherited retinal degenerative disorders characterized by progressive rod and cone dysfunction and ensuing photoreceptor loss. Many patients suffer from legal blindness by their 40s or 50s. Artificial vision is considered once patients have lost all vision to the point of bare light perception or no light perception. The Argus II retinal prosthesis system is one such artificial vision device approved for patients with RP. This review focuses on the factors important for patient selection. Careful pre-operative screening, counseling, and management of patient expectations are critical for the successful implantation and visual rehabilitation of patients with the Argus II device.","Although an increasing number of disease genes have been identified, the exact cellular mechanisms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) remain largely unclear.

Changes in the expression genes regulating cGMP hydrolysis prompted the elevation of cGMP levels, which was verified by a cGMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in patient ROs. Furthermore, significantly higher cGMP levels in patient ROs than in control ROs at D193 and D230 might lead to impaired formation of synaptic connections and the connecting cilium in photoreceptor cells. In this study, we established the first late-onset RP model with a consistent phenotype using an in vitro cell culture system and provided new insights into the PDE6B-related mechanism of RP.","Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from patient fibroblasts could potentially be used as a source of autologous cells for transplantation in retinal disease. Patient-derived iPSCs, however, would still harbor disease-causing mutations. To generate healthy patient-derived cells, mutations might be repaired with new gene-editing technology based on the bacterial system of clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9, thereby yielding grafts that require no patient immunosuppression. We tested whether CRISPR/Cas9 could be used in patient-specific iPSCs to precisely repair an RPGR point mutation that causes X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP). Fibroblasts cultured from a skin-punch biopsy of an XLRP patient were transduced to produce iPSCs carrying the patient’s c.3070G > T mutation. The iPSCs were transduced with CRISPR guide RNAs, Cas9 endonuclease and a donor homology template. Despite the gene’s repetitive and GC-rich sequences, 13% of RPGR gene copies showed mutation correction and conversion to the wild-type allele. This is the first report using CRISPR to correct a pathogenic mutation in iPSCs derived from a patient with photoreceptor degeneration. This important proof-of-concept finding supports the development of personalized iPSC-based transplantation therapies for retinal disease.","Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by reactivation of latent infection of varicella zoster virus (VZV) in sensory (cranial, dorsal root) ganglia. Major risk factors for HZ are increasing age and immunosuppression. HZ ophthalmicus (HZO) is a subset of HZ with involvement of the ophthalmic division of the fifth cranial trigeminal nerve. Approximately 4–20% of patients with HZ develop HZO. Approximately 50% of patients with HZO develop ocular disease, among whom up to 25% develop chronic or recurrent disease. Common manifestations of ocular disease include conjunctivitis, keratitis, and uveitis, whereas optic neuropathy and retinitis are uncommon. Due to the potential for vision impairment, ocular involvement requires urgent ophthalmic consultation. Early recognition and timely treatment with antivirals may prevent ocular complications. HZO is preventable by vaccination against HZ. Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness studies have been largely conducted for HZ with few studies assessing HZO. Both the recombinant adjuvanted vaccine (RZV) and live-attenuated vaccine (ZVL) significantly reduce the incidence of HZ and HZO in older adults. RZV is more effective than ZVL. Data on the effectiveness of vaccines for prevention of recurrent disease in patients with HZO are limited; however, vaccination is recommended. Despite recommendations to vaccinate individuals likely to benefit from an HZ vaccine, coverage for adults remains suboptimal. Barriers to vaccination include patient beliefs about HZ or HZ vaccines, and factors related to healthcare providers. In particular, the lack of a recommendation from their primary care physician is often cited by patients as a reason for remaining unvaccinated. By encouraging vaccination against HZ, physicians not only prevent HZ and HZO but also potential vision loss due to HZO. Graphical abstract available for this article. Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a common and painful rash that develops when the virus that causes chickenpox in children reactivates, most often in adults. When shingles affects the eye or the area surrounding the eye, it is called herpes zoster ophthalmicus, or HZO for short. Up to one-fifth of people with shingles have HZO, and this risk increases with age and in people with other conditions that affect their immune system. Common signs and symptoms include a rash on the face, pain, fever, and headache, as well as symptoms in the eye, such as discomfort, redness, and discharge. HZO has the potential to cause permanent vision loss, and because of this, it is important that people with symptoms are referred to an eye doctor (“ophthalmologist”) as soon as possible. Early diagnosis of HZO is essential for effective treatment and prevention of the more serious complications it can cause. Treatment within 3 days of the symptoms occurring, with medications known as antivirals, can shorten the duration of a shingles episode and help relieve the pain. To help prevent the risk of shingles and its subtypes like HZO, vaccination is recommended. Two vaccines are currently approved for the prevention of shingles in adults. Although these vaccinations are recommended, some people do not have them for various reasons, which include their own personal beliefs about vaccinations or that their doctor has not recommended it to them. It is important that vaccinations against shingles are recommended to all patients eligible to receive one.","Purpose To determine the feasibility of a 49-channel suprachoroidal-transretinal stimulation (STS) retinal prosthesis that was implanted for 1 year. Methods Three patients with advanced retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and with less than or equal to hand motion (HM) vision were studied. A 49-channel STS system was implanted in a scleral pocket, and the stability of the prosthesis, adverse events, and its efficacy were investigated. Results The electrode array was implanted in a scleral pocket located under the parafoveal area through a scleral incision at 14 mm in patient (Pt) 1, 16 mm in Pt 2, and 18 mm in Pt 3 from the sclerocorneal limbus. No complications occurred during surgery in all cases. During the follow-up period, iridocyclitis developed in Pt 2 and Pt 3, which was successfully treated with topical medications. The implanted devices continued functioning and elicited phosphenes in all cases. The results of localization tests (P < 0.05) and table tests (P < 0.05) were significantly better with the prosthesis turned on than turned off in Pt 3. The deviations of the walking tests were smaller with the prosthesis turned on than off in Pt 2 and Pt 3 at multiple times after the implantation. Conclusions The 49-channel STS retinal prosthesis was able to elicit phosphenes in all patients with advanced RP for the entire 1-year experimental period without major complications. Better results on visual tasks were found in the eyes in which the electrode array was implanted closer to the fovea centralis.","Lysophosphatidylserines (lyso-PSs) are a class of signaling lipids that regulate immunological and neurological processes. The metabolism of lyso-PSs remains poorly understood in vivo. Recently, we determined that ABHD12 is a major brain lyso-PS lipase, implicating lyso-PSs in the neurological disease polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and cataract (PHARC), which is caused by null mutations in the ABHD12 gene. Here, we couple activity-based profiling with pharmacological and genetic methods to annotate the poorly characterized enzyme ABHD16A as a phosphatidylserine (PS) lipase that generates lyso-PS in mammalian systems. We describe a small-molecule inhibitor of ABHD16A that depletes lyso-PSs from cells, including lymphoblasts derived from subjects with PHARC. In mouse macrophages, disruption of ABHD12 and ABHD16A respectively increases and decreases both lyso-PSs and lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production. Finally, Abhd16a(-/-) mice have decreased brain lyso-PSs, which runs counter to the elevation in lyso-PS in Abhd12(-/-) mice. Our findings illuminate an ABHD16A-ABHD12 axis that dynamically regulates lyso-PS metabolism in vivo, designating these enzymes as potential targets for treating neuroimmunological disorders.","P23H is the most common mutation in the RHODOPSIN (RHO) gene leading to a dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a rod photoreceptor degeneration that invariably causes vision loss. Specific disruption of the disease P23H RHO mutant while preserving the wild-type (WT) functional allele would be an invaluable therapy for this disease. However, various technologies tested in the past failed to achieve effective changes and consequently therapeutic benefits. We validated a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to specifically inactivate the P23H RHO mutant, while preserving the WT allele in vitro. We, then, translated this approach in vivo by delivering the CRISPR/Cas9 components in murine Rho+/P23H mutant retinae. Targeted retinae presented a high rate of cleavage in the P23H but not WT Rho allele. This gene manipulation was sufficient to slow photoreceptor degeneration and improve retinal functions. To improve the translational potential of our approach, we tested intravitreal delivery of this system by means of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). To this purpose, the employment of the AAV9-PHP.B resulted the most effective in disrupting the P23H Rho mutant. Finally, this approach was translated successfully in human cells engineered with the homozygous P23H RHO gene mutation. Overall, this is a significant proof-of-concept that gene allele specific targeting by CRISPR/Cas9 technology is specific and efficient and represents an unprecedented tool for treating RP and more broadly dominant genetic human disorders affecting the eye, as well as other tissues.",20.1376943561116,Patient Education Strategies
