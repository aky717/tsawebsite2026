The protein quality control systems involve ER-associated degradation, protein chaperons, and autophagy. ER stress is activated when proteostasis is broken with an accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins in the ER. ER stress activates an adaptive unfolded protein response to restore proteostasis by initiating protein kinase R-like ER kinase, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol requiring enzyme 1. ER stress is multifaceted, and acts on aspects at the epigenetic level, including transcription and protein processing. Accumulated data indicates its key role in protein homeostasis and other diverse functions involved in various ocular diseases, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, achromatopsia, cataracts, ocular tumors, ocular surface diseases, and myopia. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms underlying the aforementioned ocular diseases from an ER stress perspective. Drugs (chemicals, neurotrophic factors, and nanoparticles), gene therapy, and stem cell therapy are used to treat ocular diseases by alleviating ER stress. We delineate the advancement of therapy targeting ER stress to provide new treatment strategies for ocular diseases.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01570-w.pdf,

The sulfhydryl-containing tripeptide glutathione (GSH), which is synthesized and maintained at high concentrations in all cells, is one of the mechanisms by which cells protect themselves from oxidative stress. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a synthetic derivative of the endogenous amino acid L-cysteine and a precursor of GSH, has been used for several decades as a mucolytic and as an antidote to acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning. As a mucolytic, NAC breaks the disulfide bonds of heavily cross-linked mucins, thereby reducing mucus viscosity. In vitro, NAC has antifibrotic effects on lung fibroblasts. As an antidote to acetaminophen poisoning, NAC restores the hepatic GSH pool depleted in the drug detoxification process. More recently, improved knowledge of the mechanisms by which NAC acts has expanded its clinical applications. In particular, the discovery that NAC can modulate the homeostasis of glutamate has prompted studies of NAC in neuropsychiatric diseases characterized by impaired glutamate homeostasis. This narrative review provides an overview of the most relevant and recent evidence on the clinical application of NAC, with a focus on respiratory diseases, acetaminophen poisoning, disorders of the central nervous system (chronic neuropathic pain, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and addiction), cardiovascular disease, contrast-induced nephropathy, and ophthalmology (retinitis pigmentosa).",https://doi.org/10.2174/1570159x19666201230144109,

Many developments including new serotypes as well as self-complementary vectors are now entering the clinic. With these ongoing vector developments, continued effort has been focused on scalable manufacturing processes that can efficiently generate high-titer, highly pure, and potent quantities of rAAV vectors. Utilizing the relatively simple and efficient transfection system of HEK293 cells as a starting point, we have successfully adapted an adherent HEK293 cell line from a qualified clinical master cell bank to grow in animal component-free suspension conditions in shaker flasks and WAVE bioreactors that allows for rapid and scalable rAAV production. Using the triple transfection method, the suspension HEK293 cell line generates greater than 1 × 10(5) vector genome containing particles (vg)/cell or greater than 1 × 10(14) vg/l of cell culture when harvested 48 hours post-transfection. To achieve these yields, a number of variables were optimized such as selection of a compatible serum-free suspension media that supports both growth and transfection, selection of a transfection reagent, transfection conditions and cell density. A universal purification strategy, based on ion exchange chromatography methods, was also developed that results in high-purity vector preps of AAV serotypes 1-6, 8, 9 and various chimeric capsids tested. This user-friendly process can be completed within 1 week, results in high full to empty particle ratios (>90% full particles), provides postpurification yields (>1 × 10(13) vg/l) and purity suitable for clinical applications and is universal with respect to all serotypes and chimeric particles. To date, this scalable manufacturing technology has been utilized to manufacture GMP phase 1 clinical AAV vectors for retinal neovascularization (AAV2), Hemophilia B (scAAV8), giant axonal neuropathy (scAAV9), and retinitis pigmentosa (AAV2), which have been administered into patients. In addition, we report a minimum of a fivefold increase in overall vector production by implementing a perfusion method that entails harvesting rAAV from the culture media at numerous time-points post-transfection.",https://www.cell.com/article/S1525001616303343/pdf,

Eldred et al. studied organoids that recapitulate the development of the human retina and found that differentiation of cone cells into their tuned subtypes was regulated by thyroid hormone. Cones expressing short-wavelength (S) opsin developed first, and cones expressing long- and medium-wavelength (L/M) opsin developed later. The switch toward development of L/M cones depended on thyroid hormone signaling through the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor. Science, this issue p. eaau6348 Human retinal organoids offer an opportunity to study the pathways regulating development of color vision. INTRODUCTION Cone photoreceptors in the human retina enable daytime, color, and high-acuity vision. The three subtypes of human cones are defined by the visual pigment that they express: blue-opsin (short wavelength; S), green-opsin (medium wavelength; M), or red-opsin (long wavelength; L). Mutations that affect opsin expression or function cause various forms of color blindness and retinal degeneration. RATIONALE Our current understanding of the vertebrate eye has been derived primarily from the study of model organisms. We studied the human retina to understand the developmental mechanisms that generate the mosaic of mutually exclusive cone subtypes. Specification of human cones occurs in a two-step process. First, a decision occurs between S versus L/M cone fates. If the L/M fate is chosen, a subsequent choice is made between expression of L- or M-opsin. To determine the mechanism that controls the first decision between S and L/M cone fates, we studied human retinal organoids derived from stem cells. RESULTS We found that human organoids and retinas have similar distributions, gene expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. During development, S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones. This temporal switch from specification of S cones to generation of L/M cones is controlled by thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. In retinal organoids that lacked thyroid hormone receptor β (Thrβ), all cones developed into the S subtype. Thrβ binds with high affinity to triiodothyronine (T3), the more active form of TH, to regulate gene expression. We observed that addition of T3 early during development induced L/M fate in nearly all cones. Thus, TH signaling through Thrβ is necessary and sufficient to induce L/M cone fate and suppress S fate. TH exists largely in two states: thyroxine (T4), the most abundant circulating form of TH, and T3, which binds TH receptors with high affinity. We hypothesized that the retina itself could modulate TH levels to control subtype fates. We found that deiodinase 3 (DIO3), an enzyme that degrades both T3 and T4, was expressed early in organoid and retina development. Conversely, deiodinase 2 (DIO2), an enzyme that converts T4 to active T3, as well as TH carriers and transporters, were expressed later in development. Temporally dynamic expression of TH-degrading and -activating proteins supports a model in which the retina itself controls TH levels, ensuring low TH signaling early to specify S cones and high TH signaling later in development to produce L/M cones. CONCLUSION Studies of model organisms and human epidemiology often generate hypotheses about human biology that cannot be studied in humans. Organoids provide a system to determine the mechanisms of human development, enabling direct testing of hypotheses in developing human tissue. Our studies identify temporal regulation of TH signaling as a mechanism that controls cone subtype specification in humans. Consistent with our findings, preterm human infants with low T3 and T4 have an increased incidence of color vision defects. Moreover, our identification of a mechanism that generates one cone subtype while suppressing the other, coupled with successful transplantation and incorporation of stem cell–derived photoreceptors in mice, suggests that the promise of therapies to treat human diseases such as color blindness, retinitis pigmentosa, and macular degeneration will be achieved in the near future. Temporally regulated TH signaling specifies cone subtypes. (A) Embryonic stem cell–derived human retinal organoids [wild type (WT)] generate S and L/M cones. Blue, S-opsin; green, L/M-opsin. (B) Organoids that lack thyroid hormone receptor β (Thrβ KO) generate all S cones. (C) Early activation of TH signaling (WT + T3) specifies nearly all L/M cones. (D) TH-degrading enzymes (such as DIO3) expressed early in development lower TH and promote S fate, whereas TH-activating regulators (such as DIO2) expressed later promote L/M fate. The mechanisms underlying specification of neuronal subtypes within the human nervous system are largely unknown. The blue (S), green (M), and red (L) cones of the retina enable high-acuity daytime and color vision. To determine the mechanism that controls S versus L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human retinal organoids. Organoids and retinas have similar distributions, expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones, and thyroid hormone signaling controls this temporal switch. Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone–degrading and –activating proteins within the retina ensures low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones. This work establishes organoids as a model for determining mechanisms of human development with promising utility for therapeutics and vision repair.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6249681?pdf=render,

Oxidative stress has been identified as a major inducer of RPE injury, which eventually could lead to a loss of vision. Kaempferol is a natural flavonoid widely distributed in many edible plants, fruits, and traditional medicines and has been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities. The present study demonstrates that the total antioxidant capacity of kaempferol is approximately two times stronger than that of lutein which is also a natural antioxidant that is widely used in the prevention or treatment of AMD. Our data indicates that kaempferol protects human RPE cells (ARPE-19) from hydrogen peroxide- (H2O2-) induced oxidative cell damage and apoptosis through the signaling pathways involving Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3 molecules proofed by real-time PCR and Western blot results. Kaempferol also inhibits the upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression levels induced by H2O2 in ARPE-19 cells and affects the oxidation and antioxidant imbalanced system in ARPE-19 cells treated by H2O2 through the regulations of both the activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Furthermore, our in vivo experimental results show that in sodium iodate-induced retinal degeneration rat model, kaempferol could protect sodium iodate-induced pathological changes of retina tissue and retinal cells apoptosis as well as the upregulated VEGF protein expression in RPE cells. In summary, these novel findings demonstrate that kaempferol could protect oxidative stressed-human RPE cell damage through its antioxidant activity and antiapoptosis function, suggesting that kaempferol has a potential role in the prevention and therapeutic treatment of AMD or other retinal diseases mediated by oxidative stress.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/1610751,

However, instead of seeing focal spots of light, current implant users perceive highly distorted phosphenes that vary in shape both across subjects and electrodes. We characterized these distortions by asking users of the Argus retinal prosthesis system (Second Sight Medical Products Inc.) to draw electrically elicited percepts on a touchscreen. Using ophthalmic fundus imaging and computational modeling, we show that elicited percepts can be accurately predicted by the topographic organization of optic nerve fiber bundles in each subject’s retina, successfully replicating visual percepts ranging from ‘blobs’ to oriented ‘streaks’ and ‘wedges’ depending on the retinal location of the stimulating electrode.

The aim of this review is to provide evidence for this hypothesis in relation to eye disorders and to retinopathies in particular. Methods Epidemiological studies and research articles were reviewed. Results Analysis of the biological basis for a relationship between eye diseases and hormones showed that estrogen, androgen, and progesterone receptors are present throughout the eye and that these steroids are locally produced in ocular tissues. Sex hormones can have a neuroprotective action on the retina and modulate ocular blood flow. There are differences between the male and the female retina; moreover, sex hormones can influence the development (or not) of certain disorders. For example, exposure to endogenous estrogens, depending on age at menarche and menopause and number of pregnancies, and exposure to exogenous estrogens, as in hormone replacement therapy and use of oral contraceptives, appear to protect against age-related macular degeneration (both drusenoid and neurovascular types), whereas exogenous testosterone therapy is a risk factor for central serous chorioretinopathy. Macular hole is more common among women than men, particularly in postmenopausal women probably owing to the sudden drop in estrogen production in later middle age. Progestin therapy appears to ameliorate the course of retinitis pigmentosa. Diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes, may be more common among men than women. Conclusion We observed a correlation between many retinopathies and sex, probably as a result of the protective effect some gonadal hormones may exert against the development of certain disorders.

Recently, there have been major breakthroughs in retinal prosthesis technology, with the creation of numerous types of implants, including epiretinal, subretinal, and suprachoroidal sensors. These devices can stimulate the remaining cells in the retina with electric signals to create a visual sensation. A literature review of the pre-clinical and clinical studies published between 2017 and 2023 is conducted. This narrative review delves into the retinal anatomy, physiology, pathology, and principles underlying electronic retinal prostheses. Engineering aspects are explored, including electrode–retina alignment, electrode size and material, charge density, resolution limits, spatial selectivity, and bidirectional closed-loop systems. This article also discusses clinical aspects, focusing on safety, adverse events, visual function, outcomes, and the importance of rehabilitation programs. Moreover, there is ongoing debate over whether implantable retinal devices still offer a promising approach for the treatment of retinal diseases, considering the recent emergence of cell-based and gene-based therapies as well as optogenetics. This review compares retinal prostheses with these alternative therapies, providing a balanced perspective on their advantages and limitations. The recent advancements in retinal prosthesis technology are also outlined, emphasizing progress in engineering and the outlook of retinal prostheses. While acknowledging the challenges and complexities of the technology, this article highlights the significant potential of retinal prostheses for vision restoration in individuals with retinal diseases and calls for continued research and development to refine and enhance their performance, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/13/5782/pdf?version=1687331654,

Specific disruption of the disease P23H RHO mutant while preserving the wild-type (WT) functional allele would be an invaluable therapy for this disease. However, various technologies tested in the past failed to achieve effective changes and consequently therapeutic benefits. We validated a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to specifically inactivate the P23H RHO mutant, while preserving the WT allele in vitro. We, then, translated this approach in vivo by delivering the CRISPR/Cas9 components in murine Rho+/P23H mutant retinae. Targeted retinae presented a high rate of cleavage in the P23H but not WT Rho allele. This gene manipulation was sufficient to slow photoreceptor degeneration and improve retinal functions. To improve the translational potential of our approach, we tested intravitreal delivery of this system by means of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). To this purpose, the employment of the AAV9-PHP.B resulted the most effective in disrupting the P23H Rho mutant. Finally, this approach was translated successfully in human cells engineered with the homozygous P23H RHO gene mutation. Overall, this is a significant proof-of-concept that gene allele specific targeting by CRISPR/Cas9 technology is specific and efficient and represents an unprecedented tool for treating RP and more broadly dominant genetic human disorders affecting the eye, as well as other tissues.",https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article-pdf/27/5/761/24044173/ddx438.pdf,

Macrophages are found in all ocular tissues, spanning from the front surface, including the cornea, to the posterior pole, represented by the choroid/sclera. The neural retina is also populated by specialised resident macrophages called microglia. The plasticity of microglia/macrophages allows them to adopt different activation states in response to changes in the tissue microenvironment. When exposed to various factors, microglia/macrophages polarise into distinct phenotypes, each exhibiting unique characteristics and roles. Furthermore, extensive research has indicated a close association between microglia/macrophage polarisation and the development and reversal of various intraocular diseases. The present article provides a review of the recent findings on the association between microglia/macrophage polarisation and ocular pathological processes (including autoimmune uveitis, optic neuritis, sympathetic ophthalmia, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, subretinal fibrosis, uveal melanoma, ischaemic optic neuropathy, retinopathy of prematurity and choroidal neovascularization). The paradoxical role of microglia/macrophage polarisation in retinopathy of prematurity is also discussed. Several studies have shown that microglia/macrophages are involved in the pathology of ocular diseases. However, it is required to further explore the relevant mechanisms and regulatory processes.

Major risk factors for HZ are increasing age and immunosuppression. HZ ophthalmicus (HZO) is a subset of HZ with involvement of the ophthalmic division of the fifth cranial trigeminal nerve. Approximately 4–20% of patients with HZ develop HZO. Approximately 50% of patients with HZO develop ocular disease, among whom up to 25% develop chronic or recurrent disease. Common manifestations of ocular disease include conjunctivitis, keratitis, and uveitis, whereas optic neuropathy and retinitis are uncommon. Due to the potential for vision impairment, ocular involvement requires urgent ophthalmic consultation. Early recognition and timely treatment with antivirals may prevent ocular complications. HZO is preventable by vaccination against HZ. Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness studies have been largely conducted for HZ with few studies assessing HZO. Both the recombinant adjuvanted vaccine (RZV) and live-attenuated vaccine (ZVL) significantly reduce the incidence of HZ and HZO in older adults. RZV is more effective than ZVL. Data on the effectiveness of vaccines for prevention of recurrent disease in patients with HZO are limited; however, vaccination is recommended. Despite recommendations to vaccinate individuals likely to benefit from an HZ vaccine, coverage for adults remains suboptimal. Barriers to vaccination include patient beliefs about HZ or HZ vaccines, and factors related to healthcare providers. In particular, the lack of a recommendation from their primary care physician is often cited by patients as a reason for remaining unvaccinated. By encouraging vaccination against HZ, physicians not only prevent HZ and HZO but also potential vision loss due to HZO. Graphical abstract available for this article. Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a common and painful rash that develops when the virus that causes chickenpox in children reactivates, most often in adults. When shingles affects the eye or the area surrounding the eye, it is called herpes zoster ophthalmicus, or HZO for short. Up to one-fifth of people with shingles have HZO, and this risk increases with age and in people with other conditions that affect their immune system. Common signs and symptoms include a rash on the face, pain, fever, and headache, as well as symptoms in the eye, such as discomfort, redness, and discharge. HZO has the potential to cause permanent vision loss, and because of this, it is important that people with symptoms are referred to an eye doctor (“ophthalmologist”) as soon as possible. Early diagnosis of HZO is essential for effective treatment and prevention of the more serious complications it can cause. Treatment within 3 days of the symptoms occurring, with medications known as antivirals, can shorten the duration of a shingles episode and help relieve the pain. To help prevent the risk of shingles and its subtypes like HZO, vaccination is recommended. Two vaccines are currently approved for the prevention of shingles in adults. Although these vaccinations are recommended, some people do not have them for various reasons, which include their own personal beliefs about vaccinations or that their doctor has not recommended it to them. It is important that vaccinations against shingles are recommended to all patients eligible to receive one.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40121-024-00990-7.pdf,

These stressors disrupt the cellular protein and metabolic homeostasis, which, if not alleviated, can lead to dysfunction and cell death of retinal neurons. One primary cellular stress response is the highly conserved unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR acts through three main signaling pathways in an attempt to restore the protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by various means, including but not limited to, reducing protein translation, increasing protein-folding capacity, and promoting misfolded protein degradation. Moreover, recent work has identified a novel function of the UPR in regulation of cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function, disturbance of which contributes to neuronal degeneration and dysfunction. The role of the UPR in retinal neurons during aging and under disease conditions in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been explored over the past two decades. Each of the disease conditions and their corresponding animal models provide distinct challenges and unique opportunities to gain a better understanding of the role of the UPR in the maintenance of retinal health and function. We performed an extensive literature search on PubMed and Google Scholar using the following keywords: unfolded protein response, metabolism, ER stress, retinal degeneration, aging, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy.

Approximately 30–40% of human autosomal dominant (AD) RP is caused by dominantly inherited missense mutations in the rhodopsin gene. Here we show that P23H, the most frequent RP mutation in American patients, renders rhodopsin extremely prone to form high molecular weight oligomeric species in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. Aggregated P23H accumulates in aggresomes, which are pericentriolar inclusion bodies that require an intact microtubule cytoskeleton to form. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we observe that P23H aggregates in the cytoplasm even at extremely low expression levels. Our data show that the P23H mutation destabilizes the protein and targets it for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system. P23H is stabilized by proteasome inhibitors and by co-expression of a dominant negative form of ubiquitin. We show that expression of P23H, but not wild-type rhodopsin, results in a generalized impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system, suggesting a mechanism for photoreceptor degeneration that links RP to a broad class of neurodegenerative diseases.",http://www.jbc.org/article/S0021925820743103/pdf,

The maintenance of retinal layered complexity through the use of scaffold-free techniques has recently emerged as a promising approach for clinical ocular tissue engineering. In an attempt to fabricate such layered retinal model, we are proposing herein a unique inkjet bioprinting system applied to the deposition of a photoreceptor cells (PRs) layer on top of a bioprinted retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), in a precise arrangement and without any carrier material. The results showed that, after bioprinting, both RPE and PRs were well positioned in a layered structure and expressed their structural markers, which was further demonstrated by ZO1, MITF, rhodopsin, opsin B, opsin R/G and PNA immunostaining, three days after bioprinting. We also showed that considerable amounts of human vascular endothelial growth factors (hVEGF) were released from the RPE printed layer, which confirmed the formation of a functional RPE monolayer after bioprinting. Microstructures of bioprinted cells as well as phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by apical RPE microvilli were finally established through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging.

Such therapies appear to provide ultimate treatments, even though much more effective, yet biocompatible, noninvasive therapies are needed to control some disabling ocular diseases/disorders. Methods: In the current study, we have reviewed and discussed recent advancements on ocular targeted therapies. Results: On the ground that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of ophthalmic drugs need special techniques, most of ocular DDSs/devices developments have been designed to localized therapy within the eye. Application of advanced DDSs such as Subconjunctival insert/implants (e.g., latanoprost implant, Gamunex-C), episcleral implant (e.g., LX201), cationic emulsions (e.g., Cationorm™, Vekacia™, Cyclokat™), intac/punctal plug DDSs (latanoprost punctal plug delivery system, L-PPDS), and intravitreal implants (I-vitaion™, NT-501, NT- 503, MicroPump, Thethadur, IB-20089 Verisome™, Cortiject, DE-102, Retisert™, Iluvein™ and Ozurdex™) have significantly improved the treatment of ocular diseases. However, most of these DDSs/devices are applied invasively and even need surgical procedures. Of these, use of de novo technologies such as advanced stimuli-responsive nanomaterials, multimodal nanosystems (NSs)/nanoconjugates (NCs), biomacromolecualr scaffolds, and bioengineered cell therapies need to be further advanced to get better compliance and higher clinical impacts. Conclusion: Despite mankind successful battle on ocular diseases, our challenge will continue to battle the ocular disease that happen with aging. Yet, we need to understand the molecular aspects of eye diseases in a holistic way and develop ultimate treatment protocols preferably as non-invasive systems.",https://bi.tbzmed.ac.ir/PDF/bi-20170128163910,

The metabolism of lyso-PSs remains poorly understood in vivo. Recently, we determined that ABHD12 is a major brain lyso-PS lipase, implicating lyso-PSs in the neurological disease polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and cataract (PHARC), which is caused by null mutations in the ABHD12 gene. Here, we couple activity-based profiling with pharmacological and genetic methods to annotate the poorly characterized enzyme ABHD16A as a phosphatidylserine (PS) lipase that generates lyso-PS in mammalian systems. We describe a small-molecule inhibitor of ABHD16A that depletes lyso-PSs from cells, including lymphoblasts derived from subjects with PHARC. In mouse macrophages, disruption of ABHD12 and ABHD16A respectively increases and decreases both lyso-PSs and lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production. Finally, Abhd16a(-/-) mice have decreased brain lyso-PSs, which runs counter to the elevation in lyso-PS in Abhd12(-/-) mice.

However, molecular mechanisms are not fully understood yet. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood retinal barrier (oBRB) and supplies glucose, oxygen and nutrients from the fenestrated choriocapillaris to photoreceptors for visual function. Therefore, RPE dysfunction leads to photoreceptor injury/death and progression of blinding eye diseases. This study aims to understand the role of the thioredoxin (Trx) and its reductase (TrxR) redox signaling in human RPE dysfunction and cell death mechanism(s) in an in vitro system. Methods A human RPE cell line (APRE-19) was cultured in DMEM/F12 medium and treated with auranofin (AF – 4 μM, an inhibitor of TrxR) for 4 and 24 h. Mitochondrial and lysosomal function, cellular oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activity were measured using cell assays, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds were tested for blocking AF effects on RPE damage. Cell death mechanisms (LDH release to culture media) were determined using necroptosis, ferroptosis and pyroptosis inhibitors. P < 0.05 was considered significant in statistical analysis. Results Auranofin causes mitochondrial dysfunction (Δψm↓ and ATP↓), oxidative stress (H2O2↑) and mitophagic flux to lysosomes. Furthermore, the lysosomal enzyme (cathepsin L) activity is reduced while that of pro-inflammatory caspase-1 (NLRP3 inflammasome) is enhanced in ARPE-19. These effects of AF on ARPE-19 are inhibited by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (5 mM, NAC) and significantly by a combination of SS31 (mitochondrial antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox and tranilast). AF also causes cell death as measured by cytosolic LDH release/leakage, which is not inhibited by either ferrostatin-1 or necrostatin-1 (ferroptosis and necroptosis inhibitors, respectively). Conversely, AF-induced LDH release is significantly reduced by MCC950 and Ac-YVAD-cmk (NLRP3 and Caspase-1 inhibitors, respectively), suggesting a pro-inflammatory cell death by pyroptosis. Conclusion The Trx/TrxR redox system is critical for RPE function and viability. We previously showed that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is strongly induced in DR inhibiting the Trx/TrxR system and RPE dysfunction. Therefore, our results suggest that the TXNIP-Trx-TrxR redox pathway may participate in RPE dysfunction in DR and other retinal neurodegenerative diseases.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01065/pdf,

With elusive disease mechanisms, traditional surgical and medical interventions merely slow down the progression of the neurodegenerative diseases. However, the number of neurons still diminishes in many patients. Recently, stem cell therapy has been proposed as a viable option. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a widely-studied human adult stem cell population, have been discovered for more than 20 years. MSCs have been found all over the body and can be conveniently obtained from different accessible tissues: bone marrow, blood, and adipose and dental tissue. MSCs have high proliferative and differentiation abilities, providing an inexhaustible source of neurons and glia for cell replacement therapy. Moreover, MSCs also show neuroprotective effects without any genetic modification or reprogramming. In addition, the extraordinary immunomodulatory properties of MSCs enable autologous and heterologous transplantation. These qualities heighten the clinical applicability of MSCs when dealing with the pathologies of CNS disorders.

Therapies targeting inflammation have shown their potential to attenuate photoreceptor degeneration in preclinical models. Regardless of variations in genetic background, inflammatory modulation is emerging as an important role in the treatment of RP. We summarize the evidence for the role of inflammation in RP and mention therapeutic strategies where available, focusing on the modulation of innate immune signals, including TNFα signaling, TLR signaling, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, chemokine signaling and JAK/STAT signaling.

The EPIRET3 retinal implant is the first completely wireless intraocular implant for epiretinal stimulation.

METHODS Six legally blind retinitis pigmentosa patients were included in the study. In accordance with the regulations laid down in the study protocol, three 1-hour perceptual tests for each subject were performed within 4 weeks of surgery. Stimuli were charge-balanced square current pulses of various durations and current amplitudes. RESULTS All subjects reported visual percepts as a result of electrical stimulation by the implant. Thresholds for eliciting visual percepts varied between them but were below the safety limits of electrical stimulation. Stimulation success depended stronger on pulse duration than on current amplitude or total charge delivered. Subjects were able to discriminate between stimulation patterns of different orientations or at different locations of the electrode array.

Its central element is the neural retina, which senses light, processes visual signals, and transmits them to the rest of the brain through the optic nerve (ON). Surrounding the retina are numerous other structures, conventionally divided into anterior and posterior segments. Here we used high-throughput single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to classify and characterize cells in the extraretinal components of the posterior segment: ON, optic nerve head (ONH), peripheral sclera, peripapillary sclera (PPS), choroid, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Defects in each of these tissues are associated with blinding diseases – for example, glaucoma (ONH and PPS), optic neuritis (ON), retinitis pigmentosa (RPE), and age-related macular degeneration (RPE and choroid). From ∼151,000 single nuclei, we identified 37 transcriptomically distinct cell types, including multiple types of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells.

The most commonly studied preclinical model of retinitis pigmentosa called the ""rodless"" (rd1) mouse is homozygous for two mutations: a nonsense point mutation (Y347X) and an intronic insertion of a leukemia virus (Xmv-28). Distinguishing which mutation causes retinal degeneration is still under debate nearly a century after the discovery of this model organism. Here, we performed gene editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and demonstrated that the Y347X mutation is the causative variant of disease. Genome editing in the first generation produced animals that were mosaic for the corrected allele but still showed neurofunction preservation despite low repair frequencies. Furthermore, second-generation CRISPR-repaired mice showed an even more robust rescue and amelioration of the disease. This predicts excellent outcomes for gene editing in diseased human tissue, as Pde6b, the mutated gene in rd1 mice, has an orthologous intron-exon relationship comparable with the human PDE6B gene.

Using quantitative proteomics, we identified assembly intermediates containing PRPF8, EFTUD2, and SNRNP200 in association with the HSP90/R2TP complex, its ZNHIT2 cofactor, and additional proteins. HSP90 and R2TP bind unassembled U5 proteins in the cytoplasm, stabilize them, and promote the formation of the U5 snRNP.

It identifies nine fundus diseases and conditions, namely, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (mild ROP, moderate ROP, and severe ROP), retinoblastoma (RB), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Coats disease, coloboma of the choroid, congenital retinal fold (CRF), and normal. IRIDS also includes depth attention modules, ResNet-18 (Res-18), and Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT). Performance was compared to that of ophthalmologists using 450 retinal images. The IRIDS employed a five-fold cross-validation approach to generate the classification results. Several baseline models achieved the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (F1), kappa, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with best values of 94.62% (95% CI, 94.34%-94.90%), 94.07% (95% CI, 93.32%-94.82%), 90.56% (95% CI, 88.64%-92.48%), 92.34% (95% CI, 91.87%-92.81%), 91.15% (95% CI, 90.37%-91.93%), and 99.08% (95% CI, 99.07%-99.09%), respectively.

The different forms of RP consist of progressive neurodegenerative disorders which are generally related to various and severe limitations of visual performances. In the course of typical RP (rod-cone dystrophy), the affected individuals first experience night-blindness and/or visual field constriction (secondary to rod dysfunctions), followed by variable alterations of the central vision (due to cone damages). On the other hand, during the atypical form of RP (cone-rod dystrophy), the cone’s functionalities are prevalently disrupted in comparison with the rod’s ones. The basic diagnosis of RP relies upon the documentation of unremitting loss in photoreceptor activity by electroretinogram and/or visual field testing. The prevalence of all RP typologies is variably reported in about one case for each 3000-5000 individuals, with a total of about two millions of affected persons worldwide. The inherited retinal dystrophies are sometimes the epiphenomenon of a complex framework (syndromic RP), but more often they represent an isolated disorder (about 85-90 % of cases). Although 200 causative RP mutations have been hitherto detected in more than 100 different genes, the molecular defect is identifiable in just about the 50% of the analyzed patients with RP. Not only the RP genotypes are very heterogeneous, but also the patients with the same mutation can be affected by different phenotypic manifestations. RP can be inherited as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked trait, and many sporadic forms are diagnosed in patients with no affected relatives. Dissecting the clinico-genetic complexity of RP has become an attainable objective by means of large-scale research projects, in which the collaboration between ophthalmologists, geneticists, and epidemiologists becomes a crucial aspect. In the present review, the main issues regarding clinical phenotyping and epidemiologic criticisms of RP are focused, especially highlighting the importance of both standardization of the diagnostic protocols and appropriateness of the disease’s registration systems.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3131733?pdf=render,

Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers that act as key proinflammatory factors. We recently found the first-generation BET inhibitor JQ1 alleviated sodium iodate-induced retinal degeneration by suppressing cGAS-STING innate immunity. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanism of dBET6, a proteolysis‑targeting chimera (PROTAC) small molecule that selectively degrades BET by the ubiquitin‒proteasome system, in light-induced retinal degeneration. Methods Mice were exposed to bright light to induce retinal degeneration, and the activation of cGAS-STING was determined by RNA-sequencing and molecular biology. Retinal function, morphology, photoreceptor viability and retinal inflammation were examined in the presence and absence of dBET6 treatment. Results Intraperitoneal injection of dBET6 led to the rapid degradation of BET protein in the retina without detectable toxicity. dBET6 improved retinal responsiveness and visual acuity after light damage (LD). dBET6 also repressed LD-induced retinal macrophages/microglia activation, Müller cell gliosis, photoreceptor death and retinal degeneration. Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing results revealed cGAS-STING components were expressed in retinal microglia. LD led to dramatic activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, whereas dBET6 suppressed LD-induced STING expression in reactive macrophages/microglia and the related inflammatory response. Conclusions This study indicates targeted degradation of BET by dBET6 exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting cGAS-STING in reactive retinal macrophages/microglia, and is expected to become a new strategy for treatment of retinal degeneration.",https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12974-023-02804-y,

Impaired splicing has been associated with diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and cellular responses remain poorly understood. In this work, we report that deficiency of ubiquitin-specific protease 39 (USP39) in human cell lines, zebrafish larvae, and mice led to impaired spliceosome assembly and a cytotoxic splicing profile characterized by the use of cryptic 5' splice sites. Disruptive cryptic variants evaded messenger RNA (mRNA) surveillance pathways and were translated into misfolded proteins, which caused proteotoxic aggregates, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and, ultimately, cell death.

However, no effective therapy has been established to date. Although genetic mutations have been identified, the available clinical data are not always sufficient to elucidate the roles of these mutations in disease pathogenesis, a situation that is partially due to differences in genetic backgrounds. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from an RP patient carrying a rhodopsin mutation (E181K). Using helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAdV) gene transfer, the mutation was corrected in the patient’s iPSCs and also introduced into control iPSCs. The cells were then subjected to retinal differentiation; the resulting rod photoreceptor cells were labeled with an Nrl promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-carrying adenovirus and purified using flow cytometry after 5 weeks of culture. Using this approach, we found a reduced survival rate in the photoreceptor cells with the E181K mutation, which was correlated with the increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptotic markers. The screening of therapeutic reagents showed that rapamycin, PP242, AICAR, NQDI-1, and salubrinal promoted the survival of the patient’s iPSC-derived photoreceptor cells, with a concomitant reduction in markers of ER stress and apoptosis. Additionally, autophagy markers were found to be correlated with ER stress, suggesting that autophagy was reduced by suppressing ER stress-induced apoptotic changes. The use of RP patient-derived iPSCs combined with genome editing provided a versatile cellular system with which to define the roles of genetic mutations in isogenic iPSCs with or without mutation and also provided a system that can be used to explore candidate therapeutic approaches.",https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/1756-6606-7-45,

However, studies focusing on identifying the right disease among several candidates, which is a better approximation of clinical diagnosis in practice comparing with the case that aims to distinguish one particular eye disease from normal controls, are limited. The performance of existing algorithms for multi-class classification of fundus images is at most mediocre. Moreover, in many studies consisting of different eye diseases, labeled images are quite limited mainly due to privacy concern of patients. In this case, it is infeasible to train huge DCNNs, which usually have millions of parameters.

These include diabetic retinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and Alzheimer's disease. Methods Retinal oximetry is based on spectrophotometric fundus imaging and measures oxygen saturation in retinal arterioles and venules in a noninvasive, quick, safe manner. Retinal oximetry detects changes in oxygen metabolism, including those that result from ischemia or atrophy. Results In diabetic retinopathy, venous oxygen saturation increases and arteriovenous difference decreases. Both correlate with diabetic retinopathy severity as conventionally classified on fundus photographs. In CRVO, vein occlusion causes hypoxia, which is measured directly by retinal oximetry to confirm the diagnosis and measure severity. In both diseases, the change in oxygen levels is a consequence of disturbed blood flow with resulting tissue hypoxia and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. In atrophic diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and glaucoma, retinal oxygen consumption is reduced and this is detected by retinal oximetry. Retinal oximetry correlates with visual field damage and retinal atrophy. It is an objective metabolic measure of the degree of retinal atrophy. Finally, the retina is part of the central nervous system tissue and reflects central nervous system diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, a change in retinal oxygen metabolism has been discovered.

To investigate the importance of the CNGB subunits in vivo, we deleted the CNGB1 gene in mice. In the absence of CNGB1, only trace amounts of the CNGA1 subunit were found on the rod outer segment. As a consequence, the vast majority of isolated rod photoreceptors in mice lacking CNGB1 (CNGB1-/-) failed to respond to light. In electroretinograms (ERGs), CNGB1-/- mice showed no rod-mediated responses. The rods also showed a slow-progressing degeneration caused by apoptotic death and concurred by retinal gliosis. Cones were primarily unaffected and showed normal ERG responses up to 6 months, but they started to degenerate in later stages.

Microglial cells, key components of the retinal immune defense system, are activated in retinal degenerative diseases.

The excitement surrounding optogenetics has also extended to the clinic with a trial for ChR2 in the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa currently underway and additional trials anticipated for the near future. In this work, we identify the cause of loss-of-expression in response to transdermal illumination of an optogenetically active peroneal nerve following an anterior compartment (AC) injection of AAV6-hSyn-ChR2(H134R) with and without a fluorescent reporter. Using Sprague Dawley Rag2−/− rats and appropriate controls, we discover optogenetic loss-of-expression is chiefly elicited by ChR2-mediated immunogenicity in the spinal cord, resulting in both CNS motor neuron death and ipsilateral muscle atrophy in both low and high Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) dosages. We further employ pharmacological immunosuppression using a slow-release tacrolimus pellet to demonstrate sustained transdermal optogenetic expression up to 12 weeks. These results suggest that all dosages of AAV-mediated optogenetic expression within the PNS may be unsafe. Clinical optogenetics for both PNS and CNS applications should take extreme caution when employing opsins to treat disease and may require concurrent immunosuppression. Future work in optogenetics should focus on designing opsins with lesser immunogenicity.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32075-0.pdf,

Optogenetics refers to techniques that use light to control the cellular activity of targeted cells. Although optogenetics is a relatively new technology, multiple therapeutic options are already being explored in pre-clinical and phase I/II clinical trials with the aim of developing novel, safe, and effective treatments for major blinding eye diseases, such as glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa. Optogenetic approaches to visual restoration are primarily aimed at replacing lost or dysfunctional photoreceptors by inserting light-sensitive proteins into downstream retinal neurons that have no intrinsic light sensitivity. Such approaches are attractive because they are agnostic to the genetic causes of retinal degeneration, which raises hopes that all forms of retinal dystrophic and degenerative diseases could become treatable. Optogenetic strategies can also have a far-reaching impact on translational research by serving as important tools to study the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration and to identify clinically relevant therapeutic targets. For example, the CRY-CIBN optogenetic system has been recently applied to animal models of glaucoma, suggesting a potential role of OCRL in the regulation of intraocular pressure in trabecular meshwork. As optogenetic strategies are being intensely investigated, it appears crucial to consider the opportunities and challenges such therapies may offer. Here, we review the more recent promising optogenetic molecules, vectors, and applications of optogenetics for the treatment of retinal degeneration and glaucoma.

Identifying pigment signs (PS) linked with RP is crucial for monitoring and possibly slowing the disease’s degenerative course. However, the segmentation and detection of PS are challenging due to the difficulty of distinguishing between PS and blood vessels and the variability in size, shape, and color of PS. Recently, advances in deep learning techniques have shown impressive results in medical image analysis, especially in ophthalmology. This study presents an approach for classifying pigment marks in color fundus images of RP using a modified squeeze-and-excitation ResNet (SE-ResNet) architecture. This variant synergizes the efficiency of residual skip connections with the robust attention mechanism of the SE block to amplify feature representation. The SE-ResNet model was fine-tuned to determine the optimal layer configuration that balances performance metrics and computational costs. We trained the proposed model on the RIPS dataset, which comprises images from patients diagnosed at various RP stages. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed model in classifying different types of pigment signs associated with RP. The model yielded performance metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f-measure of 99.16%, 97.70%, 96.93%, 90.47%, 99.37%, 97.80%, 97.44%, and 90.60% on the testing set, based on GT1 & GT2 respectively.

This study aimed to identify changes in the levels of oxidative stress and autophagy markers in the retina of control and rd10 mice during different phases of retinal development. Changes in the retinal oxidation system were investigated by measuring the levels of oxidized and reduced glutathione (GSH/GSSG), retinal avidin-positive cells, and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) staining intensity. Autophagy characterization was explored by measuring the levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), beclin, autophagy-related proteins 5 and 7 (Atg5 and Atg7), and lysosomal associated membrane protein-2A (LAMP-2A). At P28 retinal GSH concentrations decreased in rd10 mice compared to the controls. No differences were found in retinal GSSG concentrations between the control and rd10 mice. There was an increase in retinal GSSG concentrations and a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio in the control and rd10 mice at P21 and P28 compared to P13. We observed an increase in avidin-positive cells in rd10 retinas. 4-HNE was increased in rd10 retinas at P13, and it also increased in control mice with age.

Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders (ciliopathies) such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), frequently affecting many physiological and developmental processes across multiple organs. Cilium formation, maintenance and function depend on intracellular transport systems such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dynein motors and regulated by the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) cargo-adaptor protein complex, or BBSome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis when most sensory neurons differentiate. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161 (FAM161A orthologue), CCDC-104 (CCDC104), and RPI-1 (RP1/RP1L1), which we confirm are cilium-localised in worms. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we uncover orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analyses of C. elegans RAB-28, recently associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. Whereas inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localisation, GTP-bound (activated) RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses reveal that whilst cilium structure, sensory function and IFT are seemingly normal in a rab-28 null allele, overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB-28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function. Collectively, our findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins, and unveil RAB28, a GTPase most closely related to the BBS protein RABL4/IFT27, as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.",https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006469&type=printable,

Disease-modifying therapies that mitigate pathophysiology regardless of the underlying genetic lesion are desirable due to the diversity of mutations found in such diseases. We tested a systems pharmacology-based strategy that suppresses intracellular cAMP and Ca2+ activity via G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) modulation using tamsulosin, metoprolol, and bromocriptine coadministration. The treatment improves cone photoreceptor function and slows degeneration in Pde6βrd10 and RhoP23H/WT retinitis pigmentosa mice. Cone degeneration is modestly mitigated after a 7-month-long drug infusion in PDE6A-/- dogs. The treatment also improves rod pathway function in an Rpe65-/- mouse model of Leber congenital amaurosis but does not protect from cone degeneration.

The final impact of all retinal dystrophies is the loss of photoreceptors; hence, there is a pressing need for research into replacement. Seminal work has shown that a simple three‐dimensional culture system enables differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to retinal organoids containing large numbers of photoreceptors developing alongside retinal neurons and Müller glia cells in a laminated structure that resembles the native retina. Despite these promising developments, current protocols show different efficiencies across pluripotent stem cells and result in retinal organoids with a mixture of photoreceptor cells at varying maturation states, along with nonphotoreceptor cell types. In this study, we investigated the impact of stage‐specific addition of retinoic acid (RA), 9‐cis‐retinal, 11‐cis‐retinal, levodopa (l‐DOPA), triiodothyronine (T3), and γ‐secretase inhibitor ((2S)‐N‐[(3,5‐Difluorophenyl)acetyl]‐l‐alanyl‐2‐phenyl]glycine1,1‐dimethylethyl ester2L [DAPT]) in the generation of cone and rod photoreceptors.

Incidentally, neuroprotection of retina is a defending mechanism designed to prevent or delay neuronal cell death, and to maintain neural function following an initial insult, thus avoiding loss of vision. Methods: Numerous studies have investigated potential neuroprotective properties of plant-derived phytocannabinoids, as well as of their endogenous counterparts collectively termed endocannabinoids (eCBs), in several degenerative diseases of the retina. eCBs are a group of neuromodulators that, mainly by activating G protein-coupled type-1 and type-2 cannabinoid (CB1 and CB2) receptors, trigger multiple signal transduction cascades that modulate central and peripheral cell functions. A fine balance between biosynthetic and degrading enzymes that control the right concentration of eCBs has been shown to provide neuroprotection in traumatic, ischemic, inflammatory and neurotoxic damage of the brain. Results: Since the existence of eCBs and their binding receptors was documented in the retina of numerous species (from fishes to primates), their involvement in the visual processing has been demonstrated, more recently with a focus on retinal neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. Conclusion: The aim of this review is to present a modern view of the endocannabinoid system, in order to discuss in a better perspective available data from preclinical studies on the use of eCBs as new neuroprotective agents, potentially useful to prevent glaucoma and retinal neurodegenerative diseases.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6120105?pdf=render,
