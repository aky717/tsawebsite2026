This process begins with the binding of odor molecules to receptor proteins on olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) dendrites. The major molecular components involved in olfaction include odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), chemosensory proteins (CSPs), odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) and odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs). More importantly, as potential molecular targets, chemosensory proteins are used to identify novel attractants or repellants for environmental-friendly pest management. In this study we analyzed the transcriptome of the flea beetle, Phyllotreta striolata (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), a serious pest of Brassicaceae crops, to better understand the molecular mechanisms of olfactory recognition in this pest. The analysis of transcriptomes from the antennae and terminal abdomens of specimens of both sexes identified transcripts from several key molecular components of chemoreception including 73 ORs, 36 GRs, 49 IRs, 2 SNMPs, 32 OBPs, 8 CSPs, and four candidate odorant degrading enzymes (ODEs): 143 cytochrome P450s (CYPs), 68 esterases (ESTs), 27 glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and 8 UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs). Bioinformatic analyses indicated that a large number of chemosensory genes were up-regulated in the antennae. This was consistent with a potential role in olfaction. To validate the differential abundance analyses, the expression of 19 genes encoding various ORs, CSPs, and OBPs was assessed via qRT-PCR between non-chemosensory tissue and antennae. Consistent with the bioinformatic analyses, transcripts for all of the genes in the qRT-PCR subset were elevated in antennae. These findings provide the first insights into the molecular basis of chemoreception in the striped flea beetle.","The oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata, is an economically important and common Lepidopteran pest of cereal crops. Chemoreception plays a key role in insect life, such as foraging, oviposition site selection, and mating partners. To better understand the chemosensory mechanisms in M. separata, transcriptomic analysis of antennae, labial palps, and proboscises were conducted using next-generation sequencing technology to identify members of the major chemosensory related genes. In this study, 62 putative odorant receptors (OR), 20 ionotropic receptors (IR), 16 gustatory receptors (GR), 38 odorant binding proteins (OBP), 26 chemosensory proteins (CSP), and 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMP) were identified in M. separata by bioinformatics analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of these candidate proteins was performed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis was used to determine the expressions of all candidate chemosensory genes and then the expression profiles of the three families of receptor genes were confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). The important genes for chemoreception have now been identified in M. separata. This study will provide valuable information for further functional studies of chemoreception mechanisms in this important agricultural pest.","The lightbrown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana is an increasingly global pest of horticultural crops. Like other moths, E. postvittana relies on olfactory cues to locate mates and oviposition sites. To detect these cues, moths have evolved families of genes encoding elements of the peripheral olfactory reception system, including odor carriers, receptors and degrading enzymes. Here we undertake a transcriptomic approach to identify members of these families expressed in the adult antennae of E. postvittana, describing open reading frames encoding 34 odorant binding proteins, 13 chemosensory proteins, 70 odorant receptors, 19 ionotropic receptors, nine gustatory receptors, two sensory neuron membrane proteins, 27 carboxylesterases, 20 glutathione-S-transferases, 49 cytochrome p450s and 18 takeout proteins. For the odorant receptors, quantitative RT-PCR corroborated RNAseq count data on steady state transcript levels. Of the eight odorant receptors that group phylogenetically with pheromone receptors from other moths, two displayed significant male-biased expression patterns, one displayed significant female-biased expression pattern and five were expressed equally in the antennae of both sexes. In addition, we found two male-biased odorant receptors that did not group with previously described pheromone receptors. This suite of olfaction-related genes provides a substantial resource for the functional characterization of this signal transduction system and the development of odor-mediated control strategies for horticultural pests.","Loxostege sticticalis Linnaeus is an economically important agricultural pest, and the larvae cause great damage to crops, especially in Northern China. However, effective and environmentally friendly chemical methods for controlling this pest have not been discovered to date. In the present study, we performed HiSeq2500 sequencing of transcriptomes of the male and female adult antennae, adult legs and third instar larvae, and we identified 54 candidate odorant receptors (ORs), including 1 odorant receptor coreceptor (Orco) and 5 pheromone receptors (PRs), 18 ionotropic receptors (IRs), 13 gustatory receptors (GRs), 34 odorant binding proteins (OBPs), including 1 general odorant binding protein (GOBP1) and 3 pheromone binding proteins (PBPs), 10 chemosensory proteins (CSPs) and 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs). The results of RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR analyses showed the expression levels of most genes in the antennae were higher than that in the legs and larvae. Furthermore, PR4, OR1-4, 7–11, 13–15, 23, 29–32, 34, 41, 43, 47/IR7d.2/GR5b, 45, 7/PBP2-3, GOBP1, OBP3, 8 showed female antennae-biased expression, while PR1/OBP2, 7/IR75d/CSP2 showed male antennae-biased expression. However, IR1, 7d.3, 68a/OBP11, 20–22, 28/CSP9 had larvae enriched expression, and OBP15, 17, 25, 29/CSP5 were mainly expressed in the legs. The results shown above indicated that these genes might play a key role in foraging, seeking mates and host recognition in the L. sticticalis. Our findings will provide the basic knowledge for further studies on the molecular mechanisms of the olfactory system of L. sticticalis and potential novel targets for pest control strategies.","Sensory system plays important roles in a wide array of insect’s behavior and physiological events, including the host landing and locating, feeding, flying, sex responding, mating and oviposition which happen independently and in sequence. The armyworm Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) of migratory insect is destructive for alimentarn crop and economic crop throughout the world. Here we present the high throughput sequencing of the head transcriptome and identify members of the major sensory genes which are crucial for armyworm’s success worldwide, including 8 opsins, 22 chemosensory proteins, 50 odorant binding proteins, 60 odorant receptors, 8 gustatory receptors, 24 ionotropic receptors, and 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins. It is worth noting that a duplication of the LW opsin gene exists in this insect. Several genes were clustered with functionally validated genes, such as Co-receptors of OR and IR, PBPs, PRs, CO2 GRs, bitter GRs and sweet GRs, were also identified. The transcriptome gene library provided the basis for further studies that elucidate the fundamental molecular mechanism of biology and control in M. separata. Our research exhibits the first comprehensive catalogue of the sensory genes fundamental for success and distribution in M. separata, which are potential novel targets for pest control strategies.","Apolygus lucorum (Hemiptera: Miridae), one of the main insect pests, causes severe damage in cotton and many other economic crops. As is well-known, legs play important roles in the chemoreception of insects. In this study, the putative chemosensory proteins in legs of A. lucorum involved in close or contact chemical communication of adult bugs were investigated using RNA transcriptome sequencing and qPCR methods. Transcriptome data of forelegs, middle legs and hind legs of adult bugs demonstrated that 20 odorant binding protein (OBP) genes, eight chemosensory protein (CSP) genes, one odorant receptor (OR) gene, one ionotropic receptor (IR) gene and one sensory neuron membrane protein (SNMP) gene were identified in legs of A. lucorum. Compared to the previous antennae transcriptome data, five CSPs, IR21a and SNMP2a were newly identified in legs. Results of qPCR analysis indicated that all these putative chemosensory genes were ubiquitously expressed in forelegs, middle legs and hind legs of bugs. Furthermore, four types of sensilla on legs of A. lucorum including sensilla trichodea (subtypes: long straight sensilla trichodea, Str1; long curved sensilla trichodea, Str2), sensilla chaetica (subtypes: sensilla chaetica 1, Sch1; sensilla chaetica 2, Sch2; and sensilla chaetica 3, Sch3), sensilla basiconca (subtypes: medium-long sensilla basiconca, Sba1; short sensilla basiconca, Sba2) and Böhm bristles (BB) were found using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, the largest number of sensilla was observed on hind legs, while the forelegs had the smallest number of sensilla. Our data provide valuable insights into understanding the chemoreception of legs in A. lucorum.","In insects, rapid degradation of odorants in antennae is extremely important for the sensitivity of olfactory receptor neurons. Odorant degradation in insect antennae is mediated by multiple enzymes, especially the carboxylesterases (CXEs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). The Asiatic rice borer, Chilo suppressalis, is an economically important lepidopteran pest which causes great economic damage to cultivated rice crops in many Asian countries. In this study, we identified 19 putative CXE and 16 GST genes by analyzing previously constructed antennal transcriptomes of C. suppressalis. BLASTX best hit results showed that these genes are most homologous to their respective orthologs in other lepidopteran species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that these CXE and GST genes were clustered into various clades. Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays showed that three CXE genes (CsupCXE8, CsupCXE13, and CsupCXE18) are antennae-enriched. These genes are candidates for involvement in odorant degradation. Unexpectedly, none of the GST genes were found to be antennae-specific. Our results pave the way for future researches of the odorant degradation mechanism of C. suppressalis at the molecular level.","Chemosensory genes play important roles in insect behaviors and have thus become potential molecular targets for pest control based on the manipulation of chemoreception-driven behaviors. The great gray weevil Sympiezomias velatus (Chevrolat) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is an important agricultural pest that causes serious economic losses to many crops in China, but its chemosensory genes have not been reported. Here we assembled the antennal transcriptomes of female and male adult S. velatus and revealed the major chemosensory genes necessary for olfaction. A total of 138 candidate chemosensory genes in six families were identified, including 41 encoding odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 11 encoding chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 62 encoding odorant receptors (ORs), 15 encoding gustatory receptors (GRs), six encoding ionotropic receptors (IRs), and three encoding sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs). We analyzed their phylogenetic relationship based on the amino acid sequences of these chemosensory-related protein families in S. velatus and other insects, and the expression profiles based on their antennal transcriptomes. Chemosensory genes that show antenna-abundant/specific or sex-biased expression were observed, suggesting that these genes might have functions in olfaction. Furthermore, we chose an antenna-abundant OBP belonging to ABPX subfamily, SvelOBP15, to investigate its binding property. The results showed that among 33 tested compounds, SvelOBP15 displayed high binding affinities (Ki = 7.36–12.94 μmol/L) with farnesol, nerolidol, limonene and diisobutyl phthalate, indicating that SvelOBP15 plays olfactory roles by binding and transporting specific plant volatiles. These findings will help us better understand the olfactory systems of S. velatus, and provide a basis for functional elucidation of these chemosensory genes.","Abstract Correct gustatory recognition and selection of foods both within and outside the hive by honey bee workers are fundamental to the maintenance of colonies. The tarsal chemosensilla located on the legs of workers are sensitive to nonvolatile compounds and proposed to be involved in gustatory detection. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the gustatory recognition of foods in honey bees. In the present study, RNA-seq was performed with RNA samples extracted from the legs of 1-, 10-, and 20-d-old workers of Apis cerana cerana Fabricius, a dominant indigenous crop pollinator with a keen perception ability for phytochemicals. A total of 124 candidate chemosensory proteins (CSPs), including 15 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 5 CSPs, 7 gustatory receptors (GRs), 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), and 95 odorant receptors (ORs), were identified from the assembled leg transcriptome. In silico analysis of expression showed that 36 of them were differentially expressed among the three different ages of A. c. cerana workers. Overall, the genes encoding OBPs and CSPs had great but extremely variable FPKM values and thus were highly expressed in the legs of workers, whereas the genes encoding ORs, GRs, and SNMPs (except SNMP2) were expressed at low levels. Tissue-specific expression patterns indicated that two upregulated genes, AcerOBP15 and AcerCSP3, were predominately expressed in the legs of 20-d-old foragers, suggesting they may play an essential role in gustatory recognition and selection of plant nectars and pollens. This study lays a foundation for further research on the feeding preferences of honey bees.","Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) is an invasive insect pest which, in China, causes unprecedented damage and economic losses due to its extreme fecundity and wide host range, including forest and shade trees, and even crops. Compared to the better known lepidopteran species which use Type-I pheromones, little is known at the molecular level about the olfactory mechanisms of host location and mate choice in H. cunea, a species using Type-II lepidopteran pheromones. In the present study, the H. cunea antennal transcriptome was constructed by Illumina Hiseq 2500TM sequencing, with the aim of discovering olfaction-related genes. We obtained 64,020,776 clean reads, and 59,243 unigenes from the analysis of the transcriptome, and the putative gene functions were annotated using gene ontology (GO) annotation. We further identified 124 putative chemosensory unigenes based on homology searches and phylogenetic analysis, including 30 odorant binding proteins (OBPs), 17 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 52 odorant receptors (ORs), 14 ionotropic receptors (IRs), nine gustatory receptors (GRs) and two sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs). We also found many conserved motif patterns of OBPs and CSPs using a MEME system. Moreover, we systematically analyzed expression patterns of OBPs and CSPs based on reverse transcription PCR and quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) with RNA extracted from different tissues and life stages of both sexes in H. cunea. The antennae-biased expression may provide a deeper further understanding of olfactory processing in H. cunea. The first ever identification of olfactory genes in H. cunea may provide new leads for control of this major pest.",23.5515215373837,Autoimmune Disease Treatment Innovations

It is more urgent to require an effective and fast segmentation algorithm. Therefore, a heart image can be accurately segmented from a large amount of image data and an area of interest can be extracted The segmentation algorithm is very necessary. Based on the segmentation and recognition of medical images, this paper proposes a neural network and image saliency based on the obvious difference between the heart image and other tissues in the slice, and the high similarity between adjacent slices in the CT image sequence. Fully automatic segmentation algorithm and 3D visual reconstruction is the segmented heart image. Convolutional neural network is a special deep neural network model of artificial intelligence. Its connections between neurons are not fully connected. The weights of connections between certain neurons in the same layer are shared, and the network model is reduced. The complexity reduces the number of weights. The use of visual saliency techniques to achieve cardiac segmentation based on CT images. An image saliency detection algorithm is adopted to introduce the image segmentation algorithm based on the saliency technique. In this paper, considering the PET image as grayscale image with low resolution, an improved Itti model and an improved GrabCut image segmentation algorithm are proposed to solve the problem of the original algorithm in grayscale image. At the same time, the operation steps of the user division area are cancelled, and the automatic processing is realized, and the running time of the algorithm is improved while optimizing the image segmentation effect. The convolutional neural network is constructed to realize the positioning function of the heart in the image. The original cardiac CT image is cropped by the positioning result, and some non-target areas are removed. A stacking noise reduction self-coding network is constructed, and the network is manually segmented. Training, realize the classification and recognition of the pixels belonging to the heart tissue in the CT image of the heart, and finally realize the segmentation of the heart image based on the classification result. The results of the above segmentation algorithm are quantitatively evaluated and analyzed with the artificial segmentation results, and the segmentation results are visually reconstructed by surface rendering and volume rendering. The algorithm has better accuracy, reliability and higher. The segmentation efficiency is more simplified for user operations.","Rice is a crucial food crop, but it is frequently affected by diseases during its growth process. Some of the most common diseases include rice blast, flax leaf spot, and bacterial blight. These diseases are widespread, highly infectious, and cause significant damage, posing a major challenge to agricultural development. The main problems in rice disease classification are as follows: (1) The images of rice diseases that were collected contain noise and blurred edges, which can hinder the network’s ability to accurately extract features of the diseases. (2) The classification of disease images is a challenging task due to the high intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity of rice leaf diseases. This paper proposes the Candy algorithm, an image enhancement technique that utilizes improved Canny operator filtering (the gravitational edge detection algorithm) to emphasize the edge features of rice images and minimize the noise present in the images. Additionally, a new neural network (ICAI-V4) is designed based on the Inception-V4 backbone structure, with a coordinate attention mechanism added to enhance feature capture and overall model performance. The INCV backbone structure incorporates Inception-iv and Reduction-iv structures, with the addition of involution to enhance the network’s feature extraction capabilities from a channel perspective. This enables the network to better classify similar images of rice diseases. To address the issue of neuron death caused by the ReLU activation function and improve model robustness, Leaky ReLU is utilized. Our experiments, conducted using the 10-fold cross-validation method and 10,241 images, show that ICAI-V4 has an average classification accuracy of 95.57%. These results indicate the method’s strong performance and feasibility for rice disease classification in real-life scenarios.","Aiming at the problems of incomplete classification features extraction of remote sensing images and low accuracy of crop classification in existing crop classification and recognition methods, a crop classification and recognition method using improved U-Net in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images is proposed. First, the experimental data set is preprocessed. The data set is expanded by flipping transformation, translation transformation, and random cutting, which expands the number of data sets, and then the original image is cut to meet the requirements of the experiment for image size; Moreover, the network structure of U-Net is deepened, and the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) structure is introduced after the encoder to better understand the semantic information and improve the ability of model mining data features; Finally, in order to prevent the overfitting of the deepened model, the dropout layer is introduced to weaken the joint adaptability between various neurons. Experiments show that the comprehensive OA and Kappa indexes of the proposed crop classification and recognition method based on improved U-Net are 92.14% and 0.896, respectively, which are better than the comparison methods. Therefore, the proposed method has good ability of crop classification and recognition.","Maize is a leading crop in the modern agricultural industry that accounts for more than 40% grain production worldwide. THe double haploid technique that uses fewer breeding generations for generating a maize line has accelerated the pace of development of superior commercial seed varieties and has been transforming the agricultural industry. In this technique the chromosomes of the haploid seeds are doubled and taken forward in the process while the diploids marked for elimination. Traditionally, selective visual expression of a molecular marker within the embryo region of a maize seed has been used to manually discriminate diploids from haploids. Large scale production of inbred maize lines within the agricultural industry would benefit from the development of computer vision methods for this discriminatory task. However the variability in the phenotypic expression of the molecular marker system and the heterogeneity arising out of the maize genotypes and image acquisition have been an enduring challenge towards such efforts. In this work, we propose a novel application of a deep convolutional network (DeepSort) for the sorting of haploid seeds in these realistic settings. Our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers that uses features based on color, texture and morphology. We demonstrate the network derives features that can discriminate the embryo regions using the activations of the neurons in the convolutional layers. Our experiments with different architectures show that the performance decreases with the decrease in the depth of the layers. Our proposed method DeepSort based on the convolutional network is robust to the variation in the phenotypic expression, shape of the corn seeds, and the embryo pose with respect to the camera. In the era of modern digital agriculture, deep learning and convolutional networks will continue to play an important role in advancing research and product development within the agricultural industry.","Deep learning (DL) architectures have opened new horizons in medical image analysis attaining unprecedented performance in tasks such as tissue classification and segmentation as well as prediction of several clinical outcomes. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel three-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for tissue classification in medical imaging and applied for discriminating between primary and metastatic liver tumors from diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) data. The proposed network consists of four consecutive strided 3-D convolutional layers with 3 × 3 × 3 kernel size and rectified linear unit (ReLU) as activation function, followed by a fully connected layer with 2048 neurons and a Softmax layer for binary classification. A dataset comprising 130 DW-MRI scans was used for the training and validation of the network. To the best of our knowledge this is the first DL solution for the specific clinical problem and the first 3-D CNN for cancer classification operating directly on whole 3-D tomographic data without the need of any preprocessing step such as region cropping, annotating, or detecting regions of interest. The classification performance results, 83% (3-D) versus 69.6% and 65.2% (2-D), demonstrated significant tissue classification accuracy improvement compared to two 2-D CNNs of different architectures also designed for the specific clinical problem with the same dataset. These results suggest that the proposed 3-D CNN architecture can bring significant benefit in DW-MRI liver discrimination and potentially, in numerous other tissue classification problems based on tomographic data, especially in size-limited, disease-specific clinical datasets.","COVID-19 is a type of respiratory infection that primarily affects the lungs. Obtaining a chest X-ray is one of the most important steps in detecting and treating COVID-19 occurrences. Our study's goal is to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This study presents an effective method for categorizing chest X-ray images as Normal or COVID-19 infected. We used CNN, activation functions dropout, batch normalization, and Keras parameters to build this model. The classification method was implemented using open source tools ""Python"" and ""OpenCV,"" both of which are freely available. The acquired images are transmitted through a series of convolutional and max pooling layers activated with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, and then fed into the neurons of the dense layers, and finally activated with the sigmoidal function. Thereafter, SVM was used for classification using the knowledge from the learning model to classify the images into a predefined class (COVID-19 or Normal). As the model learns, its accuracy improves while its loss decreases. The findings of the study indicate that all models produced promising results, with augmentation, image segmentation, and image cropping producing the most efficient results, with a training accuracy of 99.8% and a test accuracy of 99.1%. As a result, the findings show that deep features provided consistent and reliable features for COVID-19 detection. Therefore, the proposed method aids in faster diagnosis of COVID-19 and the screening of COVID-19 patients by radiologists.","Fine-grained image classification methods often suffer from the challenge that the subordinate categories within an entry-level category can only be distinguished by subtle differences. Crop disease classification is affected by various visual interferences, including uneven illumination, dew, and equipment jitter. It demands an effective algorithm to accurately discriminate one category from the others. Thus, the representational ability of algorithm needs to be strengthened to learn a robust domain-specific discrimination through an effective way. To address this challenge, a unified convolutional neural network (CNN) denoting the matrix-based convolutional neural network (M-bCNN) was proposed. Its hallmark is the convolutional kernel matrix, whose convolutional layers are arranged parallelly in the form of a matrix, and integrated with DropConnect, exponential linear unit, local response normalization, and so on to defeat over-fitting and vanishing gradient. With a tolerable addition of parameters, it can effectively increase the data streams, neurons, and link channels of the model compared with the commonly used plain networks. Therefore, it will create more non-linear mappings and will enhance the representational ability with a tolerable growth of parameters. The images of winter wheat leaf diseases were utilized as experimental samples for their strong similarities among sub-categories. A total of 16652 images containing eight categories were collected from Shandong Province, China, and were augmented into 83260 images. The M-bCNN delivered significant improvements and achieved an average validation accuracy of 96.5% and a testing accuracy of 90.1%; this outperformed AlexNet and VGG-16. The M-bCNN demonstrated accuracy gains with a convolutional kernel matrix in fine-grained image classification.","One of the problems in dealing with optical images for large territories (more than 10,000 sq. km) is the presence of clouds and shadows that result in having missing values in data sets. In this paper, a new approach to classification of multi-temporal optical satellite imagery with missing data due to clouds and shadows is proposed. First, self-organizing Kohonen maps (SOMs) are used to restore missing pixel values in a time series of satellite imagery. SOMs are trained for each spectral band separately using nonmissing values. Missing values are restored through a special procedure that substitutes input sample's missing components with neuron's weight coefficients. After missing data restoration, a supervised classification is performed for multi-temporal satellite images. An ensemble of neural networks, in particular multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is proposed. Ensembling of neural networks is done by the technique of average committee, i.e. to calculate the average class probability over classifiers and select the class with the highest average posterior probability for the given input sample. The proposed approach is applied for regional scale crop classification using multi temporal Landsat-8 images for the JECAM test site in Ukraine in 2013. It is shown that ensemble of MLPs provides better performance than a single neural network in terms of overall classification accuracy, kappa coefficient, and producer's and user's accuracies for separate classes. The overall accuracy more than 85% is achieved. The obtained classification map is also validated through estimated crop areas and comparison to official statistics.","As a crop with significant medicinal value and nutritional components, the market demand for bitter melon continues to grow. The diversity of bitter melon shapes has a direct impact on its market acceptance and consumer preferences, making precise identification of bitter melon germplasm resources crucial for breeding work. To address the limitations of time-consuming and less accurate traditional manual identification methods, there is a need to enhance the automation and intelligence of bitter melon phenotype detection. This study developed a bitter melon phenotype detection model named CSW-YOLO. By incorporating the ConvNeXt V2 module to replace the backbone network of YOLOv8, the model’s focus on critical target features is enhanced. Additionally, the SimAM attention mechanism was introduced to compute attention weights for neurons without increasing the parameter count, further enhancing the model’s recognition accuracy. Finally, WIoUv3 was introduced as the bounding box loss function to improve the model’s convergence speed and positioning capabilities. The model was trained and tested on a bitter melon image dataset, achieving a precision of 94.6%, a recall of 80.6%, a mAP50 of 96.7%, and an F1 score of 87.04%. These results represent improvements of 8.5%, 0.4%, 11.1%, and 4% in precision, recall, mAP50, and F1 score, respectively, over the original YOLOv8 model. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the improvements was validated through heatmap analysis and ablation experiments, demonstrating that the CSW-YOLO model can more accurately focus on target features, reduce false detection rates, and enhance generalization capabilities. Comparative tests with various mainstream deep learning models also proved the superior performance of CSW-YOLO in bitter melon phenotype detection tasks. This research provides an accurate and reliable method for bitter melon phenotype identification and also offers technical support for the visual detection technologies of other agricultural products.","Leaf canopy area is a fundamental crop growth characteristic that encompasses the spatial area covered by plants. However, non-destructive and automatic computation of lettuce canopy area is still open research. This study presents a vision-based system with color space thresholding and machine learning models in measuring the photosynthetic productivity of aquaponic lettuce based on canopy area derived from the numerical image textural features of Haralick and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Lettuce images on different growth stages with varying photosynthetic pigment intensities and geometrical structures are extracted with contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity, entropy, variance, and information measure of correlations 1 and 2 features. For multi-band color space thresholding, CIELab bested RGB, HSV, and YCbCr colour spaces in segmenting the lettuce plant with sensitivity and specificity measures of 94.77% and 97.16% respectively. For measuring the lettuce canopy area, RMSE was recorded as 50.23% for fitness function neural network (FFNN), 20.46% for radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), 15.11% for exact radial basic function neural network (RBEFNN) and 13.54% for generalized regression neural network (GRNN). Comparative analysis revealed that the two-hidden layer GRNN model with 0.09 spread value and 240 hidden neurons bested other machine learning models in terms of RMSE without overfitting.",10.4875382794432,Neurodegenerative Disease Research

The toxic effects of high-content insecticidal pyrethroid formulations are available in 0.05 g, 1.17 g, and 0.04 g pyrethroid-instilled products, namely burning coils, pyrethroid-soaked mats, and liquid formulations of pyrethroids that release pyrethroid vapor/smoke upon heating. They provided 5.46 g/kg, 21.15 g/kg, and 4.24 g/kg of toxicants to the experimental animals over a total of 3 weeks/5 h per os (p.o.) administration, producing necrosis, hyperemia, and fatty changes in the liver; fiber separation in cardiac muscles; atrophy, lymphatic infiltration, blood vessel congestion, and hyperemia in the heart tissues of the experimental animals. The glomerular tuft necrosis, cytoplasmic degeneration of renal tubular cells, necrotic tubules, congestion, and dilatation of blood vessels were observed in the kidney tissue of intoxicated animals. Air-space enlargement, interstitial inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration aggregates, connective tissue infiltration by inflammatory cells, and hyperemia were found in the lung tissues. The pyrethroid toxicants also produced nervous tissue degeneration and decreased neurons in the brain, which were observed through histopathological examinations of the brain, lungs, heart, kidneys, and liver. The protective effects of ascorbic acid (AA/vitamin C) and α-tocopherol (E307/vitamin E) at 100 mg/kg oral doses administered daily for the entire period of the toxicant exposure of three weeks to the experimental mice, aged between 3–4 months and weighing ≈30 g, ameliorated the tissue damage, as observed through the histopathological examinations. The ascorbic acid caused recovery of the liver, kidney, brain, and heart tissue damage, while α-tocopherol was effective at ameliorating the damage in the kidneys and lung tissue compared with the control groups. The high levels of tissue damage recovery suggested a prophylactic effect of the concurrent use of ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol for the subjects under the exposure of pyrethroids.","Reproduction induces increased food intake across females of many animal species1–4, providing a physiologically relevant paradigm for the exploration of appetite regulation. Here, by examining the diversity of enteric neurons in Drosophila melanogaster, we identify a key role for gut-innervating neurons with sex- and reproductive state-specific activity in sustaining the increased food intake of mothers during reproduction. Steroid and enteroendocrine hormones functionally remodel these neurons, which leads to the release of their neuropeptide onto the muscles of the crop—a stomach-like organ—after mating. Neuropeptide release changes the dynamics of crop enlargement, resulting in increased food intake, and preventing the post-mating remodelling of enteric neurons reduces both reproductive hyperphagia and reproductive fitness. The plasticity of enteric neurons is therefore key to reproductive success. Our findings provide a mechanism to attain the positive energy balance that sustains gestation, dysregulation of which could contribute to infertility or weight gain. A multi-organ circuit is activated in female flies after mating, leading to changes in enteric neurons that increase food intake.","The mechanism through which the brain senses the metabolic state, enabling an animal to regulate food consumption, and discriminate between nutritional and non-nutritional foods is a fundamental question. Flies choose the sweeter non-nutritive sugar, L-glucose, over the nutritive D-glucose if they are not starved. However, under starvation conditions, they switch their preference to D-glucose, and this occurs independent of peripheral taste neurons. Here, we found that eliminating the TRPγ channel impairs the ability of starved flies to choose D-glucose. This food selection depends on trpγ expression in neurosecretory cells in the brain that express diuretic hormone 44 (DH44). Loss of trpγ increases feeding, alters the physiology of the crop, which is the fly stomach equivalent, and decreases intracellular sugars and glycogen levels. Moreover, survival of starved trpγ flies is reduced. Expression of trpγ in DH44 neurons reverses these deficits. These results highlight roles for TRPγ in coordinating feeding with the metabolic state through expression in DH44 neuroendocrine cells.","Pesticides especially insecticides are widely used in the field of agricultural development all over the world to increase crop production. Moreover, exposure to such compounds does not only influence the intended targets but also induces adverse impacts on a number of unintended targets in animals. This research aimed to determine the toxic impacts of lufenuron (an insecticide) on the health status of fish in terms of measurement of oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes, DNA damage and histopathological changes in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) exposed to different concentrations. For this purpose, Oreochromis niloticus fish, weighing about 75-80g were arbitrarily separated into four different groups and then exposed to lufenuron @ 0.7, 1.2 and 1.7µg/ L for 39 days. The results showed that the fish exposed to the pesticide had significant changes in oxidative stress, antioxidant profile in gills and percentile rate of DNA damage in different visceral organs including liver, kidney, and gills. Results of light microscopic investigations indicated different histological changes in liver (necrosis of hepatocytes, degeneration of hepatocytes, vacuolar degeneration and congestion), gills (necrosis of lamellar epithelial cells, telangiectasia, and atrophy of secondary lamellae), heart (congestion, necrosis of neurons, microgliosis and intracellular edema), brain (congestion, myofibrosis, neutrophilic and myocarditis) and kidneys (necrosis of renal tubules, widening of urinary space, necrosis of renal tubular epithelial cells). A significantly escalate in oxidative stress while lower quantity of antioxidant biomarkers was documented in experimental fish. The findings of this study suggest that long-term exposure to lufenuron has negative health effects via induction of DNA damage, increased oxidative stress, lowering of enzymatic antioxidants profile and histological lesions in visceral organs of Nile tilapita (Oreochromis niloticus).","Neonicotinoids are synthetic, nicotine-derived insecticides used worldwide to protect crops and domestic animals from pest insects. The reported evidence shows that they are also able to interact with mammalian nicotine receptors (nAChRs), triggering detrimental responses in cultured neurons. Exposure to high neonicotinoid levels during the fetal period induces neurotoxicity in animal models. Considering the persistent exposure to these insecticides and the key role of nAChRs in brain development, their potential neurotoxicity on mammal central nervous system (CNS) needs further investigations. We studied here the neurodevelopmental effects of different generations of neonicotinoids on CNS cells in mouse fetal brain and primary cultures and in neuronal cells and organoids obtained from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Neonicotinoids significantly affect neuron viability, with imidacloprid (IMI) inducing relevant alterations in synaptic protein expression, neurofilament structures, and microglia activation in vitro, and in the brain of prenatally exposed mouse fetuses. IMI induces neurotoxic effects also on developing human iPSC-derived neurons and cortical organoids. Collectively, the current findings show that neonicotinoids might induce impairment during neuro/immune-development in mouse and human CNS cells and provide new insights in the characterization of risk for the exposure to this class of pesticides.","Since their discovery in the late 1980s, neonicotinoid pesticides have become the most widely used class of insecticides worldwide, with large-scale applications ranging from plant protection (crops, vegetables, fruits), veterinary products, and biocides to invertebrate pest control in fish farming. In this review, we address the phenyl-pyrazole fipronil together with neonicotinoids because of similarities in their toxicity, physicochemical profiles, and presence in the environment. Neonicotinoids and fipronil currently account for approximately one third of the world insecticide market; the annual world production of the archetype neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, was estimated to be ca. 20,000 tonnes active substance in 2010. There were several reasons for the initial success of neonicotinoids and fipronil: (1) there was no known pesticide resistance in target pests, mainly because of their recent development, (2) their physicochemical properties included many advantages over previous generations of insecticides (i.e., organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, etc.), and (3) they shared an assumed reduced operator and consumer risk. Due to their systemic nature, they are taken up by the roots or leaves and translocated to all parts of the plant, which, in turn, makes them effectively toxic to herbivorous insects. The toxicity persists for a variable period of time—depending on the plant, its growth stage, and the amount of pesticide applied. A wide variety of applications are available, including the most common prophylactic non-Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) application by seed coating. As a result of their extensive use and physicochemical properties, these substances can be found in all environmental compartments including soil, water, and air. Neonicotinoids and fipronil operate by disrupting neural transmission in the central nervous system of invertebrates. Neonicotinoids mimic the action of neurotransmitters, while fipronil inhibits neuronal receptors. In doing so, they continuously stimulate neurons leading ultimately to death of target invertebrates. Like virtually all insecticides, they can also have lethal and sublethal impacts on non-target organisms, including insect predators and vertebrates. Furthermore, a range of synergistic effects with other stressors have been documented. Here, we review extensively their metabolic pathways, showing how they form both compound-specific and common metabolites which can themselves be toxic. These may result in prolonged toxicity. Considering their wide commercial expansion, mode of action, the systemic properties in plants, persistence and environmental fate, coupled with limited information about the toxicity profiles of these compounds and their metabolites, neonicotinoids and fipronil may entail significant risks to the environment. A global evaluation of the potential collateral effects of their use is therefore timely. The present paper and subsequent chapters in this review of the global literature explore these risks and show a growing body of evidence that persistent, low concentrations of these insecticides pose serious risks of undesirable environmental impacts.","BACKGROUND IR3535 is among the most widely used synthetic insect repellents, particularly for the mitigation of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue, and Zika, as well as to control flies, ticks, fleas, lice, and mites. These insects are well-known vectors of deadly diseases that affect humans, livestock, and crops. Moreover, global warming could increase the populations of these vectors. RESULTS Here, we performed IR3535 dose-response analyses on Drosophila melanogaster, a well-known insect model organism, using electrophysiology and binary food choice assays. Our findings indicated that bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) are indispensable to detect IR3535. Further, potential candidate gustatory receptors were screened, among which GR47a was identified as a key molecular sensor. 0.1%-0.4% ranges of IR3535 affected larval development and mortality. Additionally, DEET (i.e., another commonly used insecticide) was found to exert synergistic effects when co-administered with IR3535. CONCLUSION Our findings confirmed that IR3535 directly activates bitter-sensing GRNs, which are mediated by GR47a. This relatively safe and highly potent insecticide can be largely used in combination with DEET to increase its efficiency to protect livestock and crops. Collectively, our findings suggest that the molecular sensors elucidated herein could be used as targets for the development of alternative insecticides. This article is protected by copyright.

Pyrethroids, derived from compounds found only in the Asteraceae, are particularly toxic to insects and have been successfully used as pesticides including on flowering crops that are visited by pollinators. Pyrethrins, from which they were derived, occur naturally in the nectar of some flowering plant species. We know relatively little about how such compounds—i.e., compounds that target sodium channels—influence pollinators at low or sub-lethal doses. Here, we exposed individual adult forager honeybees to several compounds that bind to sodium channels to identify whether these compounds affect motor function. Using an assay previously developed to identify the effect of drugs and toxins on individual bees, we investigated how acute exposure to 10 ng doses (1 ppm) of the pyrethroid insecticides (cyfluthrin, tau-fluvalinate, allethrin and permethrin) and the nectar toxins (aconitine and grayanotoxin I) affected honeybee locomotion, grooming and wing fanning behaviour. Bees exposed to these compounds spent more time upside down and fanning their wings. They also had longer bouts of standing still. Bees exposed to the nectar toxin, aconitine, and the pyrethroid, allethrin, also spent less time grooming their antennae. We also found that the concentration of the nectar toxin, grayanotoxin I (GTX), fed to bees affected the time spent upside down (i.e., failure to perform the righting reflex). Our data show that low doses of pyrethroids and other nectar toxins that target sodium channels mainly influence motor function through their effect on the righting reflex of adult worker honeybees.","Herbicides are environmental contaminants that have gained much attention due to the potential hazards they pose to human health. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in many commercial herbicides, is the most heavily applied herbicide worldwide. The recent rise in glyphosate application to corn and soy crops correlates positively with increased death rates due to Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Glyphosate has been shown to cross the blood–brain barrier in in vitro models, but has yet to be verified in vivo. Additionally, reports have shown that glyphosate exposure increases pro-inflammatory cytokines in blood plasma, particularly TNFα. Here, we examined whether glyphosate infiltrates the brain and elevates TNFα levels in 4-month-old C57BL/6J mice. Mice received either 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day of glyphosate, or a vehicle via oral gavage for 14 days. Urine, plasma, and brain samples were collected on the final day of dosing for analysis via UPLC–MS and ELISAs. Primary cortical neurons were derived from amyloidogenic APP/PS1 pups to evaluate in vitro changes in Aβ40-42 burden and cytotoxicity. RNA sequencing was performed on C57BL/6J brain samples to determine changes in the transcriptome. Our analysis revealed that glyphosate infiltrated the brain in a dose-dependent manner and upregulated TNFα in both plasma and brain tissue post-exposure. Notably, glyphosate measures correlated positively with TNFα levels. Glyphosate exposure in APP/PS1 primary cortical neurons increases levels of soluble Aβ40-42 and cytotoxicity. RNAseq revealed over 200 differentially expressed genes in a dose-dependent manner and cell-type-specific deconvolution analysis showed enrichment of key biological processes in oligodendrocytes including myelination, axon ensheathment, glial cell development, and oligodendrocyte development. Collectively, these results show for the first time that glyphosate infiltrates the brain, elevates both the expression of TNFα and soluble Aβ, and disrupts the transcriptome in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that exposure to this herbicide may have detrimental outcomes regarding the health of the general population.","The impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on insect pollinators is highly controversial. Sublethal concentrations alter the behaviour of social bees and reduce survival of entire colonies. However, critics argue that the reported negative effects only arise from neonicotinoid concentrations that are greater than those found in the nectar and pollen of pesticide-treated plants. Furthermore, it has been suggested that bees could choose to forage on other available flowers and hence avoid or dilute exposure. Here, using a two-choice feeding assay, we show that the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of three of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMD), thiamethoxam (TMX), and clothianidin (CLO), in food. Moreover, bees of both species prefer to eat more of sucrose solutions laced with IMD or TMX than sucrose alone. Stimulation with IMD, TMX and CLO neither elicited spiking responses from gustatory neurons in the bees’ mouthparts, nor inhibited the responses of sucrose-sensitive neurons. Our data indicate that bees cannot taste neonicotinoids and are not repelled by them. Instead, bees preferred solutions containing IMD or TMX, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused them to eat less food overall. This work shows that bees cannot control their exposure to neonicotinoids in food and implies that treating flowering crops with IMD and TMX presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees.",28.1968104898556,Climate Change and Health

However, differentiating between varieties can be challenging due to the similarity of the spectral characteristics of each crop. Thus, this study aimed to classify four sugarcane varieties through deep neural networks, subsequently comparing the results with traditional machine learning techniques. In order to provide more data as input for the classification models, along with the multi-band values of the pixels and vegetation indices, other information can be obtained from the sensor bands through RGB combinations by reconciling different bands so as to yield the characteristics of crop varieties. The methodology created to discriminate sugarcane varieties consisted of a dense neural network, with the number of hidden layers determined by the greedy layer-wise method and multiples of four neurons in each layer; additionally, a 5-fold evaluation in the training data was composed of Sentinel-2 band data, vegetation indices, and RGB combinations. Comparing the results acquired from each model with the hyperparameters selected by Bayesian optimisation, except for the neural network with manually defined parameters, it was possible to observe a greater precision of 99.55% in the SVM model, followed by the neural network developed by the study, random forests, and kNN. However, the final neural network model prediction resulted in the 99.48% accuracy of a six-hidden-layers network, demonstrating the potential of using neural networks in classification. Among the characteristics that contributed the most to the classification, the chlorophyll-sensitive bands, especially B6, B7, B11, and some RGB combinations, had the most impact on the correct classification of samples by the neural network model. Thus, the regions encompassing the near-infrared and shortwave infrared regions proved to be suitable for the discrimination of sugarcane varieties.","A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is of paramount importance in facilitating smart Agricultural Internet of Things (Agri-IoT). It connects numerous sensor nodes or devices to develop a robust framework for efficient and seamless communication with improved throughput for intelligent networking. Such enhancement has to be facilitated by an adequate and smart machine learning-based resource allocation approach. With the ensuing surge in the volume of devices being deployed from the smart Agri-IoT, applications such as intelligent irrigation, smart crop monitoring and smart fishery would be largely benefited. However, the existing resource allocation techniques would be inefficient for such anticipated energy-efficient networking. To this end, we develop a distributed artificial intelligence approach that applies efficient multi-agent learning over the WSN scenario for intelligent resource allocation. The approach is based on dynamic clustering which coupled tightly with the Back-Propagation Neural Network and empowered by the Particle Swarm Optimization (BPNN-PSO). We implement the overall framework using a Bayesian Neural Network, where the outputs from BPNN-PSO are supplied as weights to the underlying neuron layer. We observe that the cost function and energy consumption demonstrate a substantial improvement in terms of cooperative networking and efficient resource allocation. The approach is validated with simulations under realistic assumptions.","This work proposes a single probe imitation of multidepth capacitive soil moisture sensor for low-cost and energy-efficient implementation of IoT-assisted wireless sensor network (IoWSN) farm monitoring infrastructure. A conditioning circuit (CC) is devised to capture the behavior of soil water movement and its impact on soil moisture around the probe at different depths. The captured correlation is used to train the proposed neural network (NN) models to estimate the soil water content (SWC) at different soil depths based on a single measurement taken at the reference depth. To adjust the weight of the neurons, training and test dataset are collected through a measurement campaign. The data are collected during the cropping period of paddy vegetation by deploying 150 sensor nodes at different depths in bare land before sowing. Two NN models—artificial neural network (ANN) and bidirectional long short term memory network (BLSTM)—are proposed and compared based on the accuracy of SWC estimation. To demonstrate the efficacy of the concept, the proposed sensor design is compared with relevant soil moisture sensors reported over the past five years. The root mean square error (RMSE), ${R^{2}}$ and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)-based analysis validate the significance of the proposed NN models.","Many robust and efficient techniques are being designed to boost production for crops in the agriculture industry. Potatoes are one of the most significant crops for various uses. In this study, we examined potato leaves to detect diseases related to crops. The authors designed an efficient deep learning-based model to identify late blight and early blight illnesses in potato crops. This study proposed a sequential model for detecting diseases in the potato crop. Different classifiers based on deep learning models were then used to analyze the findings. A deep learning architecture built on an image-segmented convolutional neural network with has reached its maximum efficiency of 98.44%. The comparison of the performance of the proposed method and ensemble models showed that the proposed approach outperformed the start-of-the-art deep learning model.","Most of the world’s crops can be attacked by various diseases or pests, affecting their quality and productivity. In recent years, transfer learning with deep learning (DL) models has been used to detect diseases in maize, tomato, rice, and other crops. In the specific case of coffee, some recent works have used fixed hyperparameters to fine-tune the pre-trained models with the new dataset and/or applied data augmentation, such as image patching, to improve classifier performance. However, a detailed evaluation of the impact of architecture (e.g., backbone) and training (e.g., optimizer and learning rate) hyperparameters on the performance of coffee rust classification models has not been performed. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive study of the impact of five types of hyperparameters on the performance of coffee rust classification models. Specifically, eight pre-trained models are compared, each with four different amounts of transferred layers and three different numbers of neurons in the fully-connected (FC) layer, and the models are fine-tuned with three types of optimizers, each with three learning rate values. Comparing more than 800 models in terms of F1-score and accuracy, it is identified that the type of backbone is the hyperparameter with the greatest impact (with differences between models of up to 70%), followed by the optimizer (with differences of up to 20%). At the end of the study, specific recommendations are made on the values of the most suitable hyperparameters for the identification of this type of disease in coffee crops.","Introduction Crop pests have a great impact on the quality and yield of crops. The use of deep learning for the identification of crop pests is important for crop precise management. Methods To address the lack of data set and poor classification accuracy in current pest research, a large-scale pest data set named HQIP102 is built and the pest identification model named MADN is proposed. There are some problems with the IP102 large crop pest dataset, such as some pest categories are wrong and pest subjects are missing from the images. In this study, the IP102 data set was carefully filtered to obtain the HQIP102 data set, which contains 47,393 images of 102 pest classes on eight crops. The MADN model improves the representation capability of DenseNet in three aspects. Firstly, the Selective Kernel unit is introduced into the DenseNet model, which can adaptively adjust the size of the receptive field according to the input and capture target objects of different sizes more effectively. Secondly, in order to make the features obey a stable distribution, the Representative Batch Normalization module is used in the DenseNet model. In addition, adaptive selection of whether to activate neurons can improve the performance of the network, for which the ACON activation function is used in the DenseNet model. Finally, the MADN model is constituted by ensemble learning. Results Experimental results show that MADN achieved an accuracy and F1Score of 75.28% and 65.46% on the HQIP102 data set, an improvement of 5.17 percentage points and 5.20 percentage points compared to the pre-improvement DenseNet-121. Compared with ResNet-101, the accuracy and F1Score of MADN model improved by 10.48 percentage points and 10.56 percentage points, while the parameters size decreased by 35.37%. Deploying models to cloud servers with mobile application provides help in securing crop yield and quality.","In the work based on agroecological and technological testing of varieties of grain crops of domestic and foreign breeding, winter triticale in particular, conducted on the experimental field of the Smolensk State Agricultural Academy between 2015 and 2019, we present the methodology and results of processing the experimental data used for constructing the neural network model. Neural networks are applicable for solving tasks that are difficult for computers of traditional design and humans alike. Those are processing large volumes of experimental data, automation of image recognition, approximation of functions and prognosis. Neural networks include analyzing subject areas and weight coefficients of neurons, detecting conflict samples and outliers, normalizing data, determining the number of samples required for teaching a neural network and increasing the learning quality when their number is insufficient, as well as selecting the neural network type and decomposition based on the number of input neurons. We consider the technology of initial data processing and selecting the optimal neural network structure that allows to significantly reduce modeling errors in comparison with neural networks created with unprepared source data. Our accumulated experience of working with neural networks has demonstrated encouraging results, which indicates the prospects of this area, especially when describing processes with large amounts of variables. In order to verify the resulting neural network model, we have carried out a computational experiment, which showed the possibility of applying scientific results in practice.","Accurate prediction of soil temperature (Ts) is critical for efficient soil, water and field crop management. In this study, hourly Ts variations at 5, 10, and 30 cm soil depth were predicted for an arid site (Sirjan) and a semi-humid site (Sanandaj) in Iran. Existing machine learning models have high performance, but suffer from uncertainty and instability in prediction. Therefore, GLUE approach was implemented to quantify model uncertainty, while wavelet coherence was used to assess interactions between Ts and meteorological parameters. Standalone machine learning models (adaptive neuron fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), support vector machine model (SVM), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and multilayer perceptron (MLP)) were hybridized with four optimization algorithms (sunflower optimization (SFO), firefly algorithm (FFA), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), particle swarm optimization (PSO)) to improve Ts prediction accuracy and reduce model uncertainty. For both arid and semi-humid sites, ANFIS-SFO produced the most accurate performance at studied soil depths. At best, hybridization with SFO (ANFIS-SFO, MLP-SFO, RBFNN-SFO, SVM-SFO) decreased RMSE by 5.6%, 18%, 18.3%, and 18.2% at 5 cm, 11.8%, 10.4%, 10.6%, and 12.5% at 10 cm, and 9.1%, 12.1%, 13.9%, and 14.2% at 30 cm soil depth compared with the respective standalone models. GLUE analysis confirmed the superiority of hybrid models over the standalone models, while the hybrid models decreased the uncertainty in Ts predictions. ANFIS-SFO covered 95%, 94%, and 96% observation data at 5, 10, and 30 cm soli depths, respectively. Wavelet coherence analysis demonstrated that air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation, but not wind speed, had high coherence with Ts at different soil depths at both sites, and meteorological parameters mostly influenced Ts in upper soil layers. In conclusion, uncertainty analysis is a necessary and powerful technique to obtain an accurate and realistic prediction of Ts. In contrast, wavelet coherence analysis is a useful tool to investigate the most effective variables that strongly affect predictions.","This paper addresses the critical challenge of optimizing crop selection in agriculture to enhance food production sustainably. The problem is framed as a multi-class classification task where the goal is to recommend the most suitable crop based on a set of environmental and soil features. While traditional methods rely on time-consuming and labor-intensive expert knowledge, this work proposes a data-driven approach using machine learning. The novelty of our investigation lies in the comprehensive comparative analysis of seven machine learning algorithms and the development of a highly accurate neural network model. We utilize a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, which has been preprocessed to ensure data quality. We provide a detailed account of our feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning processes. Our proposed neural network model, with a specific architecture of 30–20–10 neurons, achieves a validation accuracy of 97.73%. This work also discusses the challenges of deploying such models, including real-world data variability and the need for model interpretability. We demonstrate that our approach, particularly the neural network model, provides a robust, scalable, and adaptable solution for crop recommendation, outperforming other models (in holistic view) like Random Forest which achieved a slightly higher accuracy of 99.5% on this specific dataset but with less generalization potential. The findings of this study can empower farmers to make informed decisions, ultimately leading to improved crop yields, enhanced soil fertility, and greater profitability.   Received: 22 May 2025 | Revised: 11 July 2025 | Accepted: 26 August 2025   Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.   Data Availability Statement The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset/data and in TechRxiv at https://www.techrxiv.org/doi/full/10.36227/techrxiv.23504496, reference number [41].   Author Contribution Statement Devendra Dahiphale: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Formal analysis, Resources, Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing, Visualization, Supervision, Project administration.

Accordingly, the objective of this investigation was to develop a method that can accurately define the most suitable environment in the greenhouse for an optimal yield of roses. Herein, an optimal and highly accurate BO-DNN surrogate model was developed (based on 300 experimental data points) for a quick and reliable classification of the rose yield environment considering some of the most influential variables including soil humidity, temperature and humidity of air, CO2 concentration, and light intensity (lux) into its architecture. Initially, two BO techniques (GP and GBRT) are used for the tuning process of the hyper-parameters (such as learning rate, batch size, number of dense nodes, number of dense neurons, number of input nodes, activation function, etc.). After that, an optimal and simple combination of the hyper-parameters was selected to develop a DNN algorithm based on 300 data points, which was further used to classify the rose yield environment (the rose yield environments were classified into four classes such as soil without water, correct environment, too hot, and very cold environments). The very high accuracy of the proposed surrogate model (0.98) originated from the introduction of the most vital soil and meteorological parameters as the inputs of the model. The proposed method can help in identifying intelligent greenhouse environments for efficient crop yields.",26.4975961267209,Diagnostic Accuracy Improvement

This paper offers an overview analysis of current plant-based disease detection systems. In this analysis, using a CNN, equipped with a bell pepper plant image dataset, a variety of simulation approaches for neurons and layers were used. Plant diseases cause significant growth and economic losses, as well as a reduction in the quality and quantity of agricultural products. In monitoring large crop fields, the detection of plant diseases in a day has received increasing attention. Good plant health and disease identification data through effective management strategies may promote disease control. This approach would increase the production of crops. Bugs known as aphids spread viruses. That's why control of insects is so important to control pepper plant problems. Pepper-related diseases will devastate your entire garden like a virus or wilt. When you find issues with the pepper crop, the best thing to do is destroy the infected plant before it infects the entire garden. As it is understood Once trained on larger datasets, convolutional networks may learn features, there is no need to worry about image quality.","Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is an important legume crop grown mainly in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. This underutilized legume can withstand harsh environmental conditions including drought and flooding. During drought-induced famines, this protein-rich legume serves as a food source for poor farmers when other crops fail under harsh environmental conditions; however, its use is limited because of the presence of an endogenous neurotoxic nonprotein amino acid β-N-oxalyl-l-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP). Long-term consumption of Lathyrus and β-ODAP is linked to lathyrism, which is a degenerative motor neuron syndrome. Pharmacological studies indicate that nutritional deficiencies in methionine and cysteine may aggravate the neurotoxicity of β-ODAP. The biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of β-ODAP is poorly understood, but is linked to sulfur metabolism. To date, only a limited number of studies have been conducted in grass pea on the sulfur assimilatory enzymes and how these enzymes regulate the biosynthesis of β-ODAP. Here, we review the current knowledge on the role of sulfur metabolism in grass pea and its contribution to β-ODAP biosynthesis. Unraveling the fundamental steps and regulation of β-ODAP biosynthesis in grass pea will be vital for the development of improved varieties of this underutilized legume.","This paper presents a study on a memristive two-neuron-based Hopfield neural network with fractional-order derivatives. The equilibrium points of the system are identified, and their stability is analyzed. Bifurcation diagrams are obtained by varying the magnetic induction strength and the fractional-order derivative, revealing significant changes in the system dynamics. It is observed that lower fractional orders result in an extended bistability region. Also, chaos is only observed for larger magnetic strengths and fractional orders. Additionally, the application of the fractional-order model for image encryption is explored. The results demonstrate that the encryption based on the fractional model is efficient with high key sensitivity. It leads to an encrypted image with high entropy, neglectable correlation coefficient, and uniform distribution. Furthermore, the encryption system shows resistance to differential attacks, cropping attacks, and noise pollution. The Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) calculations indicate that using a fractional derivative yields a higher PSNR compared to an integer derivative.","Predicting the function of noncoding variation is a major challenge in modern genetics. In this study, we used massively parallel reporter assays to screen 5706 variants identified from genome-wide association studies for both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), identifying 320 functional regulatory variants (frVars) across 27 loci, including the complex 17q21.31 region. We identified and validated multiple risk loci using CRISPR interference or excision, including complement 4 (C4A) and APOC1 in AD and PLEKHM1 and KANSL1 in PSP. Functional variants disrupt transcription factor binding sites converging on enhancers with cell type–specific activity in PSP and AD, implicating a neuronal SP1-driven regulatory network in PSP pathogenesis. These analyses suggest that noncoding genetic risk is driven by common genetic variants through their aggregate activity on specific transcriptional programs. Description Zooming in on dementia genes Neurodegenerative disorders are a major problem worldwide, and their incidence is continuing to increase. These are usually complex polygenic traits, and although many gene loci have been identified in association with these disorders, the functional roles of these loci are unclear and most of them fall within noncoding regions of the genome. Cooper et al. used massively parallel reporter assays to screen noncoding variants reported in genome-wide association studies of two neurodegenerative disorders, followed by functional validation in neurons and microglia. With this combination of methods, the authors identified regulatory variants in several different genes that play functional roles in disease pathogenesis as well as interactions between these genes. —YN High-throughput functional analysis reveals cell-type-specific regulatory networks that mediate genetic risk for dementia. INTRODUCTION The widespread adoption of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has revolutionized the detection of genetic loci associated with complex traits. However, identification of the causal variants and mechanisms underlying genotype–phenotype associations poses an enormous challenge because most common susceptibility loci reside in noncoding genomic regions and are composed of many correlated polymorphisms owing to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) permit the high-throughput functional characterization of noncoding genetic variation, yet they have not been systematically applied to neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we used MPRA coupled with CRISPR-based validation to identify likely causal genetic variants underlying two neurodegenerative conditions that are neuropathologically linked by intracellular tau protein aggregation—Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). RATIONALE Neurodegenerative dementias such as AD and PSP are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are no disease-modifying therapeutics for either disorder, motivating major efforts to characterize disease pathogenesis. Identifying causal genetic factors and downstream associated risk genes are fundamental initial steps in developing a mechanistic understanding that would enable therapeutic development. RESULTS We tested the transcriptional regulatory activity of 5706 noncoding single-nucleotide variants, representing 25 genome-wide significant loci associated with AD and nine loci associated with PSP, by MPRA, using the neuroepithelial-like human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cell line. We identified 320 different functional regulatory variants (frVars) that affect gene expression within 27 of these loci. AD frVars were enriched within microglial enhancers, whereas PSP frVars were enriched within neuronal enhancers and, to a lesser extent, oligodendrocytes, consistent with differential cellular impact in each disease. The majority of frVars (94%) overlapped two or more known functional annotations in human brain tissue or blood, nearly two-thirds of which were predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding, indicating their potential relevance in human disease. Forty-two high-confidence regulatory variants distributed across 15 AD loci and three PSP loci were selected for validation, using either CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) or direct CRISPR excision in induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, enabling validation of 19 functional variants, implicating 20 risk genes across 11 loci. Our data provide evidence implicating C4A, PVRL2, and APOC1 as risk genes in AD and PLEKHM1 and KANSL1 as risk genes in PSP, as well as additional validation for more than a dozen other genes. MPRA-defined functional variants preferentially disrupt predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that converge on enhancers with differential cell type–specific activity in PSP and AD, implicating a neuronal SP1-driven regulatory network in PSP pathogenesis. CONCLUSION We provide systematic characterization of common variants underlying disease risk for two distinct neurodegenerative disorders, AD and PSP. Our work illustrates the utility of integrating multiplexed reporter and CRISPR assays to efficiently characterize noncoding disease-associated variation, thereby permitting the identification of risk genes, even in complex loci with high LD. These analyses support a mechanism underlying noncoding genetic risk, whereby common genetic variants drive disease risk in aggregate through polygenic cell type–specific regulatory effects on specific gene networks. Massively parallel functional genomics identifies genes and mechanisms in dementia. We used MPRA to screen thousands of common genetic variants associated with either AD or PSP to identify 300 likely functional regulatory variants. When coupled with CRISPR editing, this approach permitted the dissection of multiple risk loci and identification of several risk genes. The ability to view the aggregate activity of genetic risk shows convergence on disease- and cell type–specific transcriptional networks.

In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) models were used for predicting maize in the major maize producing provinces of South Africa. The maize production prediction and projection analysis were carried out using the following climate variables: precipitation (PRE), maximum temperature (TMX), minimum temperature (TMN), potential evapotranspiration (PET), soil moisture (SM) and land cultivated (Land) for maize. The analyzed datasets spanned from 1990 to 2017 and were divided into two segments with 80% used for model training and the remaining 20% for testing. The results indicated that PET, PRE, TMN, TMX, Land, and SM with two hidden neurons of vector (5,8) were the best combination to predict maize production in the Free State province, whereas the TMN, TMX, PET, PRE, SM and Land with vector (7,8) were the best combination for predicting maize in KwaZulu-Natal province. In addition, the TMN, SM and Land and TMN, TMX, SM and Land with vector (3,4) were the best combination for maize predicting in the North West and Mpumalanga provinces, respectively. The comparison between the actual and predicted maize production using the testing data indicated performance accuracy adjusted R2 of 0.75 for Free State, 0.67 for North West, 0.86 for Mpumalanga and 0.82 for KwaZulu-Natal. Furthermore, a decline in the projected maize production was observed across all the selected provinces (except the Free State province) from 2018 to 2019. Thus, the developed model can help to enhance the decision making process of the farmers and policymakers.","The larvae of the cabbage root fly induce serious damage to cultivated crops of the family Brassicaceae. We here report the biochemical characterisation of neuropeptides from the central nervous system and neurohemal organs, as well as regulatory peptides from enteroendocrine midgut cells of the cabbage maggot. By LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF and chemical labelling with 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate, 38 peptides could be identified, representing major insect peptide families: allatostatin A, allatostatin C, FMRFamide-like peptides, kinin, CAPA peptides, pyrokinins, sNPF, myosuppressin, corazonin, SIFamide, sulfakinins, tachykinins, NPLP1-peptides, adipokinetic hormone and CCHamide 1. We also report a new peptide (Yamide) which appears to be homolog to an amidated eclosion hormone-associated peptide in several Drosophila species. Immunocytochemical characterisation of the distribution of several classes of peptide-immunoreactive neurons and enteroendocrine cells shows a very similar but not identical peptide distribution to Drosophila. Since peptides regulate many vital physiological and behavioural processes such as moulting or feeding, our data may initiate the pharmacological testing and development of new specific peptide-based protection methods against the cabbage root fly and its larva.","In this study we report the effects of fungal metabolites isolated from cultures of the fungus Trichoderma citrinoviride ITEM 4484 on the feeding preference of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, a major pest of cereal crops. Different phagodeterrent metabolites were purified by a combination of direct and reverse phase column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography. Chemical investigations, by spectroscopic and chemical methods, led to the identification of different long chain primary alcohols (LCOHs) of the general formula R-OH, wherein R is a long, unbranched, unsubstituted, linear aliphatic group. LCOHs have been reported as components of lepidopteran pheromone blends, but their phagodeterrent effect to aphids is herein reported for the first time. The effects of LCOHs on R. padi were studied by behavioral and electrophysiological bioassays. Feeding preference tests that were carried out with winged and wingless morphs of R. padi showed that LCOHs had high phagodeterrent activity and restrained aphids from settling on treated leaves at a concentration as low as 0.15 mM (0.036 g/l). The results of different electrophysiological analyses indicated that taste receptor neurons located on the aphid tarsomeres were involved in the LCOHs perception. Behavioral assays carried out with some commercial agrochemicals, including azadirachtin A, pyrethrum and a mineral oil-based product, in combination with 1-hexadecanol, the LCOH most abundantly produced by T. citrinoviride ITEM 4484, showed that these different active principles could be applied together, resulting in a useful increase of the phagodeterrent effect. The data shown indicate that these compounds can be profitably utilized for novel applications in biotechnical control of aphid pests. Furthermore, the tested LCOHs have no chiral centers and therefore can be obtained with good yield and at low cost through chemical synthesis, as well as from natural sources.","Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a common secondary metabolite of Aspergillus ochraceus, A. carbonarius, and Penicillium verrucosum. This mycotoxin is largely present as a contaminant in several cereal crops and human foodstuffs, including grapes, corn, nuts, and figs, among others. Preclinical studies have reported the involvement of OTA in metabolic, physiologic, and immunologic disturbances as well as in carcinogenesis. More recently, it has also been suggested that OTA may impair hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo and that this might be associated with learning and memory deficits. Furthermore, aside from its widely proven toxicity in tissues other than the brain, there is reason to believe that OTA contributes to neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, in this present in vivo study, we investigated this possibility by intraperitoneally (i.p.) administering 3.5 mg OTA/kg body weight to adult male mice to assess whether chronic exposure to this mycotoxin negatively affects cell viability in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry assays showed that doses of 3.5 mg/kg caused a significant and dose-dependent reduction in repetitive cell division and branching (from 12% to 62%). Moreover, the number of countable astrocytes (p < 0.001), young neurons (p < 0.001), and mature neurons (p < 0.001) negatively correlated with the number of i.p. OTA injections administered (one, two, three, or six repeated doses). Our results show that OTA induced adverse effects in the hippocampus cells of adult mice brain tissue when administered in cumulative doses.","Behavior evolution can promote the emergence of agricultural pests by changing their ecological niche. For example, the insect pest Drosophila suzukii has shifted its oviposition (egg-laying) niche from fermented fruits to ripe, non-fermented fruits, causing significant damage to a wide range of fruit crops worldwide. We investigate the chemosensory changes underlying this evolutionary shift and ask whether fruit sugars, which are depleted during fermentation, are important gustatory cues that direct D. suzukii oviposition to sweet, ripe fruits. We show that D. suzukii has expanded its range of oviposition responses to lower sugar concentrations than the model D. melanogaster, which prefers to lay eggs on fermented fruit. The increased response of D. suzukii to sugar correlates with an increase in the value of sugar relative to a fermented strawberry substrate in oviposition decisions. In addition, we show by genetic manipulation of sugar-gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) that sugar perception is required for D. suzukii to prefer a ripe substrate over a fermented substrate, but not for D. melanogaster to prefer the fermented substrate. Thus, sugar is a major determinant of D. suzukii’s choice of complex substrates. Calcium imaging experiments in the brain’s primary gustatory center (suboesophageal zone) show that D. suzukii GRNs are not more sensitive to sugar than their D. melanogaster counterparts, suggesting that increased sugar valuation is encoded in downstream circuits of the central nervous system (CNS). Taken together, our data suggest that evolutionary changes in central brain sugar valuation computations are involved in driving D. suzukii’s oviposition preference for sweet, ripe fruit.","Several neonicotinoids have recently been shown to activate the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) on human neurons. Moreover, imidacloprid (IMI) and other members of this pesticide family form a set of diverse metabolites within crops. Among these, desnitro-imidacloprid (DN-IMI) is of special toxicological interest, as there is evidence (i) for human dietary exposure to this metabolite, (ii) and that DN-IMI is a strong trigger of mammalian nicotinic responses. We set out here to quantify responses of human nAChRs to DN-IMI and an alternative metabolite, IMI-olefin. To evaluate toxicological hazards, these data were then compared to those of IMI and nicotine. Ca2+-imaging experiments on human neurons showed that DN-IMI exhibits an agonistic effect on nAChRs at sub-micromolar concentrations (equipotent with nicotine) while IMI-olefin activated the receptors less potently (in a similar range as IMI). Direct experimental data on the interaction with defined receptor subtypes were obtained by heterologous expression of various human nAChR subtypes in Xenopus laevis oocytes and measurement of the transmembrane currents evoked by exposure to putative ligands. DN-IMI acted on the physiologically important human nAChR subtypes α7, α3β4, and α4β2 (high-sensitivity variant) with similar potency as nicotine. IMI and IMI-olefin were confirmed as nAChR agonists, although with 2–3 orders of magnitude lower potency. Molecular docking studies, using receptor models for the α7 and α4β2 nAChR subtypes supported an activity of DN-IMI similar to that of nicotine. In summary, these data suggest that DN-IMI functionally affects human neurons similar to the well-established neurotoxicant nicotine by triggering α7 and several non-α7 nAChRs.",11.2665335665965,Chronic Pain Digital Management
