In this review, we address the phenyl-pyrazole fipronil together with neonicotinoids because of similarities in their toxicity, physicochemical profiles, and presence in the environment. Neonicotinoids and fipronil currently account for approximately one third of the world insecticide market; the annual world production of the archetype neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, was estimated to be ca. 20,000 tonnes active substance in 2010. There were several reasons for the initial success of neonicotinoids and fipronil: (1) there was no known pesticide resistance in target pests, mainly because of their recent development, (2) their physicochemical properties included many advantages over previous generations of insecticides (i.e., organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, etc.), and (3) they shared an assumed reduced operator and consumer risk. Due to their systemic nature, they are taken up by the roots or leaves and translocated to all parts of the plant, which, in turn, makes them effectively toxic to herbivorous insects. The toxicity persists for a variable period of time—depending on the plant, its growth stage, and the amount of pesticide applied. A wide variety of applications are available, including the most common prophylactic non-Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) application by seed coating. As a result of their extensive use and physicochemical properties, these substances can be found in all environmental compartments including soil, water, and air. Neonicotinoids and fipronil operate by disrupting neural transmission in the central nervous system of invertebrates. Neonicotinoids mimic the action of neurotransmitters, while fipronil inhibits neuronal receptors. In doing so, they continuously stimulate neurons leading ultimately to death of target invertebrates. Like virtually all insecticides, they can also have lethal and sublethal impacts on non-target organisms, including insect predators and vertebrates. Furthermore, a range of synergistic effects with other stressors have been documented. Here, we review extensively their metabolic pathways, showing how they form both compound-specific and common metabolites which can themselves be toxic. These may result in prolonged toxicity. Considering their wide commercial expansion, mode of action, the systemic properties in plants, persistence and environmental fate, coupled with limited information about the toxicity profiles of these compounds and their metabolites, neonicotinoids and fipronil may entail significant risks to the environment. A global evaluation of the potential collateral effects of their use is therefore timely. The present paper and subsequent chapters in this review of the global literature explore these risks and show a growing body of evidence that persistent, low concentrations of these insecticides pose serious risks of undesirable environmental impacts.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-014-3470-y.pdf,

Sublethal concentrations alter the behaviour of social bees and reduce survival of entire colonies. However, critics argue that the reported negative effects only arise from neonicotinoid concentrations that are greater than those found in the nectar and pollen of pesticide-treated plants. Furthermore, it has been suggested that bees could choose to forage on other available flowers and hence avoid or dilute exposure. Here, using a two-choice feeding assay, we show that the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of three of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMD), thiamethoxam (TMX), and clothianidin (CLO), in food. Moreover, bees of both species prefer to eat more of sucrose solutions laced with IMD or TMX than sucrose alone. Stimulation with IMD, TMX and CLO neither elicited spiking responses from gustatory neurons in the bees’ mouthparts, nor inhibited the responses of sucrose-sensitive neurons. Our data indicate that bees cannot taste neonicotinoids and are not repelled by them. Instead, bees preferred solutions containing IMD or TMX, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused them to eat less food overall. This work shows that bees cannot control their exposure to neonicotinoids in food and implies that treating flowering crops with IMD and TMX presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772122,

In this study, we used massively parallel reporter assays to screen 5706 variants identified from genome-wide association studies for both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), identifying 320 functional regulatory variants (frVars) across 27 loci, including the complex 17q21.31 region.

These analyses suggest that noncoding genetic risk is driven by common genetic variants through their aggregate activity on specific transcriptional programs. Description Zooming in on dementia genes Neurodegenerative disorders are a major problem worldwide, and their incidence is continuing to increase. These are usually complex polygenic traits, and although many gene loci have been identified in association with these disorders, the functional roles of these loci are unclear and most of them fall within noncoding regions of the genome. Cooper et al. used massively parallel reporter assays to screen noncoding variants reported in genome-wide association studies of two neurodegenerative disorders, followed by functional validation in neurons and microglia. With this combination of methods, the authors identified regulatory variants in several different genes that play functional roles in disease pathogenesis as well as interactions between these genes. —YN High-throughput functional analysis reveals cell-type-specific regulatory networks that mediate genetic risk for dementia. INTRODUCTION The widespread adoption of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has revolutionized the detection of genetic loci associated with complex traits. However, identification of the causal variants and mechanisms underlying genotype–phenotype associations poses an enormous challenge because most common susceptibility loci reside in noncoding genomic regions and are composed of many correlated polymorphisms owing to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) permit the high-throughput functional characterization of noncoding genetic variation, yet they have not been systematically applied to neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we used MPRA coupled with CRISPR-based validation to identify likely causal genetic variants underlying two neurodegenerative conditions that are neuropathologically linked by intracellular tau protein aggregation—Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). RATIONALE Neurodegenerative dementias such as AD and PSP are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are no disease-modifying therapeutics for either disorder, motivating major efforts to characterize disease pathogenesis. Identifying causal genetic factors and downstream associated risk genes are fundamental initial steps in developing a mechanistic understanding that would enable therapeutic development. RESULTS We tested the transcriptional regulatory activity of 5706 noncoding single-nucleotide variants, representing 25 genome-wide significant loci associated with AD and nine loci associated with PSP, by MPRA, using the neuroepithelial-like human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cell line. We identified 320 different functional regulatory variants (frVars) that affect gene expression within 27 of these loci. AD frVars were enriched within microglial enhancers, whereas PSP frVars were enriched within neuronal enhancers and, to a lesser extent, oligodendrocytes, consistent with differential cellular impact in each disease. The majority of frVars (94%) overlapped two or more known functional annotations in human brain tissue or blood, nearly two-thirds of which were predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding, indicating their potential relevance in human disease. Forty-two high-confidence regulatory variants distributed across 15 AD loci and three PSP loci were selected for validation, using either CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) or direct CRISPR excision in induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, enabling validation of 19 functional variants, implicating 20 risk genes across 11 loci. Our data provide evidence implicating C4A, PVRL2, and APOC1 as risk genes in AD and PLEKHM1 and KANSL1 as risk genes in PSP, as well as additional validation for more than a dozen other genes. MPRA-defined functional variants preferentially disrupt predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that converge on enhancers with differential cell type–specific activity in PSP and AD, implicating a neuronal SP1-driven regulatory network in PSP pathogenesis. CONCLUSION We provide systematic characterization of common variants underlying disease risk for two distinct neurodegenerative disorders, AD and PSP. Our work illustrates the utility of integrating multiplexed reporter and CRISPR assays to efficiently characterize noncoding disease-associated variation, thereby permitting the identification of risk genes, even in complex loci with high LD. These analyses support a mechanism underlying noncoding genetic risk, whereby common genetic variants drive disease risk in aggregate through polygenic cell type–specific regulatory effects on specific gene networks. Massively parallel functional genomics identifies genes and mechanisms in dementia. We used MPRA to screen thousands of common genetic variants associated with either AD or PSP to identify 300 likely functional regulatory variants. When coupled with CRISPR editing, this approach permitted the dissection of multiple risk loci and identification of several risk genes. The ability to view the aggregate activity of genetic risk shows convergence on disease- and cell type–specific transcriptional networks.

THe double haploid technique that uses fewer breeding generations for generating a maize line has accelerated the pace of development of superior commercial seed varieties and has been transforming the agricultural industry. In this technique the chromosomes of the haploid seeds are doubled and taken forward in the process while the diploids marked for elimination. Traditionally, selective visual expression of a molecular marker within the embryo region of a maize seed has been used to manually discriminate diploids from haploids. Large scale production of inbred maize lines within the agricultural industry would benefit from the development of computer vision methods for this discriminatory task. However the variability in the phenotypic expression of the molecular marker system and the heterogeneity arising out of the maize genotypes and image acquisition have been an enduring challenge towards such efforts. In this work, we propose a novel application of a deep convolutional network (DeepSort) for the sorting of haploid seeds in these realistic settings. Our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers that uses features based on color, texture and morphology. We demonstrate the network derives features that can discriminate the embryo regions using the activations of the neurons in the convolutional layers. Our experiments with different architectures show that the performance decreases with the decrease in the depth of the layers. Our proposed method DeepSort based on the convolutional network is robust to the variation in the phenotypic expression, shape of the corn seeds, and the embryo pose with respect to the camera. In the era of modern digital agriculture, deep learning and convolutional networks will continue to play an important role in advancing research and product development within the agricultural industry.",https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12859-018-2267-2,

In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel three-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for tissue classification in medical imaging and applied for discriminating between primary and metastatic liver tumors from diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) data. The proposed network consists of four consecutive strided 3-D convolutional layers with 3 × 3 × 3 kernel size and rectified linear unit (ReLU) as activation function, followed by a fully connected layer with 2048 neurons and a Softmax layer for binary classification. A dataset comprising 130 DW-MRI scans was used for the training and validation of the network. To the best of our knowledge this is the first DL solution for the specific clinical problem and the first 3-D CNN for cancer classification operating directly on whole 3-D tomographic data without the need of any preprocessing step such as region cropping, annotating, or detecting regions of interest. The classification performance results, 83% (3-D) versus 69.6% and 65.2% (2-D), demonstrated significant tissue classification accuracy improvement compared to two 2-D CNNs of different architectures also designed for the specific clinical problem with the same dataset. These results suggest that the proposed 3-D CNN architecture can bring significant benefit in DW-MRI liver discrimination and potentially, in numerous other tissue classification problems based on tomographic data, especially in size-limited, disease-specific clinical datasets.",,

The novelty of our investigation lies in the comprehensive comparative analysis of seven machine learning algorithms and the development of a highly accurate neural network model. We utilize a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, which has been preprocessed to ensure data quality. We provide a detailed account of our feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning processes.

Glyphosate, the active ingredient in many commercial herbicides, is the most heavily applied herbicide worldwide. The recent rise in glyphosate application to corn and soy crops correlates positively with increased death rates due to Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Glyphosate has been shown to cross the blood–brain barrier in in vitro models, but has yet to be verified in vivo. Additionally, reports have shown that glyphosate exposure increases pro-inflammatory cytokines in blood plasma, particularly TNFα. Here, we examined whether glyphosate infiltrates the brain and elevates TNFα levels in 4-month-old C57BL/6J mice. Mice received either 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day of glyphosate, or a vehicle via oral gavage for 14 days. Urine, plasma, and brain samples were collected on the final day of dosing for analysis via UPLC–MS and ELISAs. Primary cortical neurons were derived from amyloidogenic APP/PS1 pups to evaluate in vitro changes in Aβ40-42 burden and cytotoxicity. RNA sequencing was performed on C57BL/6J brain samples to determine changes in the transcriptome. Our analysis revealed that glyphosate infiltrated the brain in a dose-dependent manner and upregulated TNFα in both plasma and brain tissue post-exposure. Notably, glyphosate measures correlated positively with TNFα levels. Glyphosate exposure in APP/PS1 primary cortical neurons increases levels of soluble Aβ40-42 and cytotoxicity. RNAseq revealed over 200 differentially expressed genes in a dose-dependent manner and cell-type-specific deconvolution analysis showed enrichment of key biological processes in oligodendrocytes including myelination, axon ensheathment, glial cell development, and oligodendrocyte development. Collectively, these results show for the first time that glyphosate infiltrates the brain, elevates both the expression of TNFα and soluble Aβ, and disrupts the transcriptome in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that exposure to this herbicide may have detrimental outcomes regarding the health of the general population.",https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12974-022-02544-5,

Crop disease classification is affected by various visual interferences, including uneven illumination, dew, and equipment jitter. It demands an effective algorithm to accurately discriminate one category from the others. Thus, the representational ability of algorithm needs to be strengthened to learn a robust domain-specific discrimination through an effective way. To address this challenge, a unified convolutional neural network (CNN) denoting the matrix-based convolutional neural network (M-bCNN) was proposed. Its hallmark is the convolutional kernel matrix, whose convolutional layers are arranged parallelly in the form of a matrix, and integrated with DropConnect, exponential linear unit, local response normalization, and so on to defeat over-fitting and vanishing gradient. With a tolerable addition of parameters, it can effectively increase the data streams, neurons, and link channels of the model compared with the commonly used plain networks. Therefore, it will create more non-linear mappings and will enhance the representational ability with a tolerable growth of parameters. The images of winter wheat leaf diseases were utilized as experimental samples for their strong similarities among sub-categories. A total of 16652 images containing eight categories were collected from Shandong Province, China, and were augmented into 83260 images. The M-bCNN delivered significant improvements and achieved an average validation accuracy of 96.5% and a testing accuracy of 90.1%; this outperformed AlexNet and VGG-16.

Here, by examining the diversity of enteric neurons in Drosophila melanogaster, we identify a key role for gut-innervating neurons with sex- and reproductive state-specific activity in sustaining the increased food intake of mothers during reproduction. Steroid and enteroendocrine hormones functionally remodel these neurons, which leads to the release of their neuropeptide onto the muscles of the crop—a stomach-like organ—after mating. Neuropeptide release changes the dynamics of crop enlargement, resulting in increased food intake, and preventing the post-mating remodelling of enteric neurons reduces both reproductive hyperphagia and reproductive fitness. The plasticity of enteric neurons is therefore key to reproductive success. Our findings provide a mechanism to attain the positive energy balance that sustains gestation, dysregulation of which could contribute to infertility or weight gain.

Some of the most common diseases include rice blast, flax leaf spot, and bacterial blight. These diseases are widespread, highly infectious, and cause significant damage, posing a major challenge to agricultural development. The main problems in rice disease classification are as follows: (1) The images of rice diseases that were collected contain noise and blurred edges, which can hinder the network’s ability to accurately extract features of the diseases. (2) The classification of disease images is a challenging task due to the high intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity of rice leaf diseases. This paper proposes the Candy algorithm, an image enhancement technique that utilizes improved Canny operator filtering (the gravitational edge detection algorithm) to emphasize the edge features of rice images and minimize the noise present in the images. Additionally, a new neural network (ICAI-V4) is designed based on the Inception-V4 backbone structure, with a coordinate attention mechanism added to enhance feature capture and overall model performance. The INCV backbone structure incorporates Inception-iv and Reduction-iv structures, with the addition of involution to enhance the network’s feature extraction capabilities from a channel perspective. This enables the network to better classify similar images of rice diseases. To address the issue of neuron death caused by the ReLU activation function and improve model robustness, Leaky ReLU is utilized. Our experiments, conducted using the 10-fold cross-validation method and 10,241 images, show that ICAI-V4 has an average classification accuracy of 95.57%.

Use of volatile compounds, such as essential oils (EOs), to repel insect pests and disrupt their olfaction-driven behaviors has great practical significance in integrated pest management. However, our knowledge on the olfaction-based mechanisms of EO repellency is quite limited. RESULTS We evaluated the repellency of peppermint oil and nine plant EO components in Drosophila melanogaster, a model insect for olfaction study, and Drosophila suzukii, a major fruit crop pest. All nine volatiles, menthone, (-)-menthol, menthyl acetate, (R)-(+)-limonene, nerol, (+)-fenchone, (-)-α-thujone, camphor, norcamphor and peppermint oil, elicited repellency in D. melanogaster in a dose-dependent manner. Most of the compounds, except camphor, also elicited repellency in D. suzukii. Menthone, (R)-(+)-limonene and (+)-fenchone were the most potent repellents against D. suzukii. Repellency was reduced or abolished in two D. melanogaster mutants of the odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco), indicating that the observed repellency is odorant receptor (Or)-mediated. Repellency by peppermint oil, menthone, (R)-(+)-limonene, (-)-α-thujone and norcamphor also involves Or-independent mechanism(s). Single sensillum recording from both species revealed that common and distinct Ors and olfactory receptor neurons were activated by these compounds. CONCLUSIONS The tested plant EO components evoke repellency by activating multiple Ors in both Drosophila species. Our study provides a foundation for further elucidation of the mechanism of EOs repellency and species-specific olfactory adaptations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",,

Such enhancement has to be facilitated by an adequate and smart machine learning-based resource allocation approach. With the ensuing surge in the volume of devices being deployed from the smart Agri-IoT, applications such as intelligent irrigation, smart crop monitoring and smart fishery would be largely benefited. However, the existing resource allocation techniques would be inefficient for such anticipated energy-efficient networking. To this end, we develop a distributed artificial intelligence approach that applies efficient multi-agent learning over the WSN scenario for intelligent resource allocation. The approach is based on dynamic clustering which coupled tightly with the Back-Propagation Neural Network and empowered by the Particle Swarm Optimization (BPNN-PSO). We implement the overall framework using a Bayesian Neural Network, where the outputs from BPNN-PSO are supplied as weights to the underlying neuron layer. We observe that the cost function and energy consumption demonstrate a substantial improvement in terms of cooperative networking and efficient resource allocation.

Moreover, imidacloprid (IMI) and other members of this pesticide family form a set of diverse metabolites within crops. Among these, desnitro-imidacloprid (DN-IMI) is of special toxicological interest, as there is evidence (i) for human dietary exposure to this metabolite, (ii) and that DN-IMI is a strong trigger of mammalian nicotinic responses. We set out here to quantify responses of human nAChRs to DN-IMI and an alternative metabolite, IMI-olefin. To evaluate toxicological hazards, these data were then compared to those of IMI and nicotine. Ca2+-imaging experiments on human neurons showed that DN-IMI exhibits an agonistic effect on nAChRs at sub-micromolar concentrations (equipotent with nicotine) while IMI-olefin activated the receptors less potently (in a similar range as IMI). Direct experimental data on the interaction with defined receptor subtypes were obtained by heterologous expression of various human nAChR subtypes in Xenopus laevis oocytes and measurement of the transmembrane currents evoked by exposure to putative ligands. DN-IMI acted on the physiologically important human nAChR subtypes α7, α3β4, and α4β2 (high-sensitivity variant) with similar potency as nicotine. IMI and IMI-olefin were confirmed as nAChR agonists, although with 2–3 orders of magnitude lower potency. Molecular docking studies, using receptor models for the α7 and α4β2 nAChR subtypes supported an activity of DN-IMI similar to that of nicotine. In summary, these data suggest that DN-IMI functionally affects human neurons similar to the well-established neurotoxicant nicotine by triggering α7 and several non-α7 nAChRs.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00204-021-03168-z.pdf,

The use of deep learning for the identification of crop pests is important for crop precise management. Methods To address the lack of data set and poor classification accuracy in current pest research, a large-scale pest data set named HQIP102 is built and the pest identification model named MADN is proposed. There are some problems with the IP102 large crop pest dataset, such as some pest categories are wrong and pest subjects are missing from the images. In this study, the IP102 data set was carefully filtered to obtain the HQIP102 data set, which contains 47,393 images of 102 pest classes on eight crops. The MADN model improves the representation capability of DenseNet in three aspects. Firstly, the Selective Kernel unit is introduced into the DenseNet model, which can adaptively adjust the size of the receptive field according to the input and capture target objects of different sizes more effectively. Secondly, in order to make the features obey a stable distribution, the Representative Batch Normalization module is used in the DenseNet model. In addition, adaptive selection of whether to activate neurons can improve the performance of the network, for which the ACON activation function is used in the DenseNet model. Finally, the MADN model is constituted by ensemble learning. Results Experimental results show that MADN achieved an accuracy and F1Score of 75.28% and 65.46% on the HQIP102 data set, an improvement of 5.17 percentage points and 5.20 percentage points compared to the pre-improvement DenseNet-121. Compared with ResNet-101, the accuracy and F1Score of MADN model improved by 10.48 percentage points and 10.56 percentage points, while the parameters size decreased by 35.37%.

Colony loss is due, in part, to the high viral loads of Deformed wing virus (DWV), transmitted by the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, especially throughout the overwintering period of a honey bee colony. Covert DWV infection is commonplace and has been causally linked to precocious foraging, which itself has been linked to colony loss. Taking advantage of four brain transcriptome studies that unexpectedly revealed evidence of covert DWV-A infection, we set out to explore whether this effect is due to DWV-A mimicking naturally occurring changes in brain gene expression that are associated with behavioral maturation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that brain gene expression profiles of DWV-A infected bees resembled those of foragers, even in individuals that were much younger than typical foragers. In addition, brain transcriptional regulatory network analysis revealed a positive association between DWV-A infection and transcription factors previously associated with honey bee foraging behavior. Surprisingly, single-cell RNA-Sequencing implicated glia, not neurons, in this effect; there are relatively few glial cells in the insect brain and they are rarely associated with behavioral plasticity. Covert DWV-A infection also has been linked to impaired learning, which together with precocious foraging can lead to increased occurrence of infected bees from one colony mistakenly entering another colony, especially under crowded modern apiary conditions. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which DWV-A affects honey bee health and colony survival.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59808-4.pdf,

In this paper, a new approach to classification of multi-temporal optical satellite imagery with missing data due to clouds and shadows is proposed. First, self-organizing Kohonen maps (SOMs) are used to restore missing pixel values in a time series of satellite imagery. SOMs are trained for each spectral band separately using nonmissing values. Missing values are restored through a special procedure that substitutes input sample's missing components with neuron's weight coefficients. After missing data restoration, a supervised classification is performed for multi-temporal satellite images. An ensemble of neural networks, in particular multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is proposed. Ensembling of neural networks is done by the technique of average committee, i.e. to calculate the average class probability over classifiers and select the class with the highest average posterior probability for the given input sample. The proposed approach is applied for regional scale crop classification using multi temporal Landsat-8 images for the JECAM test site in Ukraine in 2013. It is shown that ensemble of MLPs provides better performance than a single neural network in terms of overall classification accuracy, kappa coefficient, and producer's and user's accuracies for separate classes. The overall accuracy more than 85% is achieved.

This underutilized legume can withstand harsh environmental conditions including drought and flooding. During drought-induced famines, this protein-rich legume serves as a food source for poor farmers when other crops fail under harsh environmental conditions; however, its use is limited because of the presence of an endogenous neurotoxic nonprotein amino acid β-N-oxalyl-l-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP). Long-term consumption of Lathyrus and β-ODAP is linked to lathyrism, which is a degenerative motor neuron syndrome. Pharmacological studies indicate that nutritional deficiencies in methionine and cysteine may aggravate the neurotoxicity of β-ODAP. The biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of β-ODAP is poorly understood, but is linked to sulfur metabolism. To date, only a limited number of studies have been conducted in grass pea on the sulfur assimilatory enzymes and how these enzymes regulate the biosynthesis of β-ODAP. Here, we review the current knowledge on the role of sulfur metabolism in grass pea and its contribution to β-ODAP biosynthesis.

However, a detailed evaluation of the impact of architecture (e.g., backbone) and training (e.g., optimizer and learning rate) hyperparameters on the performance of coffee rust classification models has not been performed. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive study of the impact of five types of hyperparameters on the performance of coffee rust classification models.

Comparing more than 800 models in terms of F1-score and accuracy, it is identified that the type of backbone is the hyperparameter with the greatest impact (with differences between models of up to 70%), followed by the optimizer (with differences of up to 20%).

In this study we analyzed the transcriptome of the flea beetle, Phyllotreta striolata (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), a serious pest of Brassicaceae crops, to better understand the molecular mechanisms of olfactory recognition in this pest. The analysis of transcriptomes from the antennae and terminal abdomens of specimens of both sexes identified transcripts from several key molecular components of chemoreception including 73 ORs, 36 GRs, 49 IRs, 2 SNMPs, 32 OBPs, 8 CSPs, and four candidate odorant degrading enzymes (ODEs): 143 cytochrome P450s (CYPs), 68 esterases (ESTs), 27 glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and 8 UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs).

Understanding the effect of pesticides on nurse bees is important because the fitness of nurse bees is critical for in-hive activities, such as larval survival and performing hive maintenance. In order to evaluate the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone on nurse bees, flupyradifurone at five different concentrations was selected to feed both larvae and nurse bees. Our results showed that nurse bees were more sensitive to flupyradifurone than larvae (LD50 of the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone was 17.72 μg a.i./larva and 3.368 μg a.i./nurse bee). In addition, the apoptotic rates of neurons in mushroom bodies of nurse bees were significantly induced by flupyradifurone at sublethal concentrations (8 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 50 mg/L) and the median lethal concentration LC50 (125 mg/L). The expression of immune-related genes (Hsp90, Toll-8/Tollo, and defensin) was significantly changed in exposed nurse bees at the field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone. However, three detoxifying enzyme genes (CYP9Q1, -2, and -3) were not affected by pesticide exposure. Our data suggest that although flupyradifurone had a relatively lower acute oral toxicity than many other common pesticides, exposures to the field-realistic and other sublethal concentrations of flupyradifurone still have cytotoxicity and immune-responsive effects on nurse bees.

In order to provide more data as input for the classification models, along with the multi-band values of the pixels and vegetation indices, other information can be obtained from the sensor bands through RGB combinations by reconciling different bands so as to yield the characteristics of crop varieties. The methodology created to discriminate sugarcane varieties consisted of a dense neural network, with the number of hidden layers determined by the greedy layer-wise method and multiples of four neurons in each layer; additionally, a 5-fold evaluation in the training data was composed of Sentinel-2 band data, vegetation indices, and RGB combinations.

In this study, hourly Ts variations at 5, 10, and 30 cm soil depth were predicted for an arid site (Sirjan) and a semi-humid site (Sanandaj) in Iran. Existing machine learning models have high performance, but suffer from uncertainty and instability in prediction. Therefore, GLUE approach was implemented to quantify model uncertainty, while wavelet coherence was used to assess interactions between Ts and meteorological parameters. Standalone machine learning models (adaptive neuron fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), support vector machine model (SVM), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and multilayer perceptron (MLP)) were hybridized with four optimization algorithms (sunflower optimization (SFO), firefly algorithm (FFA), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), particle swarm optimization (PSO)) to improve Ts prediction accuracy and reduce model uncertainty. For both arid and semi-humid sites, ANFIS-SFO produced the most accurate performance at studied soil depths. At best, hybridization with SFO (ANFIS-SFO, MLP-SFO, RBFNN-SFO, SVM-SFO) decreased RMSE by 5.6%, 18%, 18.3%, and 18.2% at 5 cm, 11.8%, 10.4%, 10.6%, and 12.5% at 10 cm, and 9.1%, 12.1%, 13.9%, and 14.2% at 30 cm soil depth compared with the respective standalone models.

Wavelet coherence analysis demonstrated that air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation, but not wind speed, had high coherence with Ts at different soil depths at both sites, and meteorological parameters mostly influenced Ts in upper soil layers.

For example, the insect pest Drosophila suzukii has shifted its oviposition (egg-laying) niche from fermented fruits to ripe, non-fermented fruits, causing significant damage to a wide range of fruit crops worldwide. We investigate the chemosensory changes underlying this evolutionary shift and ask whether fruit sugars, which are depleted during fermentation, are important gustatory cues that direct D. suzukii oviposition to sweet, ripe fruits. We show that D. suzukii has expanded its range of oviposition responses to lower sugar concentrations than the model D. melanogaster, which prefers to lay eggs on fermented fruit. The increased response of D. suzukii to sugar correlates with an increase in the value of sugar relative to a fermented strawberry substrate in oviposition decisions. In addition, we show by genetic manipulation of sugar-gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) that sugar perception is required for D. suzukii to prefer a ripe substrate over a fermented substrate, but not for D. melanogaster to prefer the fermented substrate. Thus, sugar is a major determinant of D. suzukii’s choice of complex substrates. Calcium imaging experiments in the brain’s primary gustatory center (suboesophageal zone) show that D. suzukii GRNs are not more sensitive to sugar than their D. melanogaster counterparts, suggesting that increased sugar valuation is encoded in downstream circuits of the central nervous system (CNS). Taken together, our data suggest that evolutionary changes in central brain sugar valuation computations are involved in driving D. suzukii’s oviposition preference for sweet, ripe fruit.",https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002432&type=printable,

One of the key goals of UAV based spraying is achieving spray coverage that is as uniform as possible to ensure maximum spray efficacy. Most of the existing studies in the literature focus on analysing the effects of spraying parameters on the uniformity of coverage distribution using experimental studies. However, in this work, we propose a novel generalized data-driven optimal path-planning framework aimed at finding the optimal operational flight parameters (flight speed and pass widths) for a lawnmower coverage path plan to meet the specified spray coverage rate while ensuring the uniformity. The framework takes a spray distribution model as an input and computes the optimal operational parameters for the coverage path plan to minimize coverage non-uniformity without making any assumptions on the UAV type. Furthermore, we also propose a neural network structure using Gaussian kernel neurons to design the spraying model using experimental data. The neural network structure makes no assumption about the type of UAV, onboard nozzle placement, or the flight parameters. The accuracy of the modelling solution only depends on the quality of the training data. In other words, higher diversity of the training data in terms of the flight and spraying parameters would result in a modelling solution that is more representative of the spraying distribution and consequently improve the quality of the operational parameters obtained from the proposed optimization framework. In this work, we present a case study to demonstrate the use case and test the performance of the proposed framework via simulation and experiments using the DJI AGRAS-T10 drone. The results showed that the optimal pass-width solutions for low forward speeds were similar to optimizing the positioning of the nozzles on a boom sprayer to achieve uniform coverage.

Odorant degradation in insect antennae is mediated by multiple enzymes, especially the carboxylesterases (CXEs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). The Asiatic rice borer, Chilo suppressalis, is an economically important lepidopteran pest which causes great economic damage to cultivated rice crops in many Asian countries. In this study, we identified 19 putative CXE and 16 GST genes by analyzing previously constructed antennal transcriptomes of C. suppressalis. BLASTX best hit results showed that these genes are most homologous to their respective orthologs in other lepidopteran species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that these CXE and GST genes were clustered into various clades. Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays showed that three CXE genes (CsupCXE8, CsupCXE13, and CsupCXE18) are antennae-enriched. These genes are candidates for involvement in odorant degradation. Unexpectedly, none of the GST genes were found to be antennae-specific.

In this study, the putative chemosensory proteins in legs of A. lucorum involved in close or contact chemical communication of adult bugs were investigated using RNA transcriptome sequencing and qPCR methods. Transcriptome data of forelegs, middle legs and hind legs of adult bugs demonstrated that 20 odorant binding protein (OBP) genes, eight chemosensory protein (CSP) genes, one odorant receptor (OR) gene, one ionotropic receptor (IR) gene and one sensory neuron membrane protein (SNMP) gene were identified in legs of A. lucorum. Compared to the previous antennae transcriptome data, five CSPs, IR21a and SNMP2a were newly identified in legs. Results of qPCR analysis indicated that all these putative chemosensory genes were ubiquitously expressed in forelegs, middle legs and hind legs of bugs. Furthermore, four types of sensilla on legs of A. lucorum including sensilla trichodea (subtypes: long straight sensilla trichodea, Str1; long curved sensilla trichodea, Str2), sensilla chaetica (subtypes: sensilla chaetica 1, Sch1; sensilla chaetica 2, Sch2; and sensilla chaetica 3, Sch3), sensilla basiconca (subtypes: medium-long sensilla basiconca, Sba1; short sensilla basiconca, Sba2) and Böhm bristles (BB) were found using scanning electron microscopy.

Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examine snmp genes of Helicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas. In silico expression and qRT‐PCR analyses showed that, just as the B. mori snmp genes, H. armigera snmp1 (Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae. Harmsnmp2 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts. Harmsnmp3 is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels of Harmsnmp2 and Harmsnmp3 differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant‐feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein–protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13.

Pyrethroids, derived from compounds found only in the Asteraceae, are particularly toxic to insects and have been successfully used as pesticides including on flowering crops that are visited by pollinators. Pyrethrins, from which they were derived, occur naturally in the nectar of some flowering plant species. We know relatively little about how such compounds—i.e., compounds that target sodium channels—influence pollinators at low or sub-lethal doses. Here, we exposed individual adult forager honeybees to several compounds that bind to sodium channels to identify whether these compounds affect motor function. Using an assay previously developed to identify the effect of drugs and toxins on individual bees, we investigated how acute exposure to 10 ng doses (1 ppm) of the pyrethroid insecticides (cyfluthrin, tau-fluvalinate, allethrin and permethrin) and the nectar toxins (aconitine and grayanotoxin I) affected honeybee locomotion, grooming and wing fanning behaviour. Bees exposed to these compounds spent more time upside down and fanning their wings. They also had longer bouts of standing still. Bees exposed to the nectar toxin, aconitine, and the pyrethroid, allethrin, also spent less time grooming their antennae. We also found that the concentration of the nectar toxin, grayanotoxin I (GTX), fed to bees affected the time spent upside down (i.e., failure to perform the righting reflex). Our data show that low doses of pyrethroids and other nectar toxins that target sodium channels mainly influence motor function through their effect on the righting reflex of adult worker honeybees.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133733&type=printable,

To address the limitations of time-consuming and less accurate traditional manual identification methods, there is a need to enhance the automation and intelligence of bitter melon phenotype detection. This study developed a bitter melon phenotype detection model named CSW-YOLO. By incorporating the ConvNeXt V2 module to replace the backbone network of YOLOv8, the model’s focus on critical target features is enhanced. Additionally, the SimAM attention mechanism was introduced to compute attention weights for neurons without increasing the parameter count, further enhancing the model’s recognition accuracy. Finally, WIoUv3 was introduced as the bounding box loss function to improve the model’s convergence speed and positioning capabilities. The model was trained and tested on a bitter melon image dataset, achieving a precision of 94.6%, a recall of 80.6%, a mAP50 of 96.7%, and an F1 score of 87.04%.

We discovered that brain neurons regulating food ingestion, IN18, receive excitatory input from enteric sensory neurons, which innervate the oesophagus and express the sugar receptor Gr43a. These enteric sensory neurons monitor the sugar content of food within the oesophagus during ingestion and send positive feedback signals to IN1s, stimulating the consumption of high-sugar foods. Connectome analyses reveal that IN1s form a core ingestion circuit. This interoceptive circuit receives synaptic input from enteric afferents and provides synaptic output to enteric motor neurons, which modulate the activity of muscles at the entry segments of the crop, a stomach-like food storage organ. While IN1s are persistently activated upon ingestion of sugar-rich foods, enteric motor neurons are continuously inhibited, causing the crop muscles to relax and enabling flies to consume large volumes of sugar.

Swarm formation requires massive reproduction as well as aggregation of the animals. Pheromones that are detected via the olfactory system have been reported to control both reproductive and aggregation behavior. However, the molecular basis of pheromone detection in the antennae of Schistocerca gregaria is unknown. As an initial step to disclose pheromone receptors, we sequenced the antennal transcriptome of the desert locust. By subsequent bioinformatical approaches, 119 distinct nucleotide sequences encoding candidate odorant receptors (ORs) were identified. Phylogenetic analyses employing the identified ORs from Schistocerca gregaria (SgreORs) and OR sequences from the related species Locusta migratoria revealed a group of locust ORs positioned close to the root, i.e. at a basal site in a phylogenetic tree. Within this particular OR group (termed basal or b-OR group), the locust OR sequences were strictly orthologous, a trait reminiscent of pheromone receptors from lepidopteran species. In situ hybridization experiments with antennal tissue demonstrated expression of b-OR types from Schistocerca gregaria in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of either sensilla trichodea or sensilla basiconica, both of which have been reported to respond to pheromonal substances. More importantly, two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments showed that most b-OR types were expressed in cells co-expressing the “sensory neuron membrane protein 1” (SNMP1), a marker indicative of pheromone-sensitive OSNs in insects. Analyzing the expression of a larger number of SgreOR types outside the b-OR group revealed that only a few of them were co-expressed with SNMP1.

The great gray weevil Sympiezomias velatus (Chevrolat) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is an important agricultural pest that causes serious economic losses to many crops in China, but its chemosensory genes have not been reported. Here we assembled the antennal transcriptomes of female and male adult S. velatus and revealed the major chemosensory genes necessary for olfaction. A total of 138 candidate chemosensory genes in six families were identified, including 41 encoding odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 11 encoding chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 62 encoding odorant receptors (ORs), 15 encoding gustatory receptors (GRs), six encoding ionotropic receptors (IRs), and three encoding sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs). We analyzed their phylogenetic relationship based on the amino acid sequences of these chemosensory-related protein families in S. velatus and other insects, and the expression profiles based on their antennal transcriptomes. Chemosensory genes that show antenna-abundant/specific or sex-biased expression were observed, suggesting that these genes might have functions in olfaction. Furthermore, we chose an antenna-abundant OBP belonging to ABPX subfamily, SvelOBP15, to investigate its binding property. The results showed that among 33 tested compounds, SvelOBP15 displayed high binding affinities (Ki = 7.36–12.94 μmol/L) with farnesol, nerolidol, limonene and diisobutyl phthalate, indicating that SvelOBP15 plays olfactory roles by binding and transporting specific plant volatiles. These findings will help us better understand the olfactory systems of S. velatus, and provide a basis for functional elucidation of these chemosensory genes.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.907667/pdf,

Control of this insect pest may be achieved by interfering with olfactory pathways to block detection of female-produced sex pheromones and consequently, disrupt mating. The first component of this pathway is the pheromone-binding protein AtraPBP1, which recognizes the pheromone and presents it to the odorant receptor housed in a sensory neuron of the male antennae. Release of the ligand depends on a pH-induced conformational change associated with the acidity of the membrane surface. To characterize this conformational change and to understand how pheromones bind, we have determined the high resolution crystal structures of AtraPBP1 in complex with two main constituents of the sex pheromone, i.e., (11Z,13Z)-hexadecadienal and (11Z,13Z)-hexadecadienol. Comparison with the structure of the unliganded form demonstrates a large ∼90° movement of the C-terminal helix which is observed in other pheromone- or odorant-binding proteins accompanied by an unpredicted 37° displacement of the N-terminal helix. Molecular dynamic trajectories suggest that the conformational change of the α1 helix facilitates the movement of the C-terminal helix.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053840&type=printable,

These insects are well-known vectors of deadly diseases that affect humans, livestock, and crops. Moreover, global warming could increase the populations of these vectors. RESULTS Here, we performed IR3535 dose-response analyses on Drosophila melanogaster, a well-known insect model organism, using electrophysiology and binary food choice assays. Our findings indicated that bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) are indispensable to detect IR3535. Further, potential candidate gustatory receptors were screened, among which GR47a was identified as a key molecular sensor. 0.1%-0.4% ranges of IR3535 affected larval development and mortality. Additionally, DEET (i.e., another commonly used insecticide) was found to exert synergistic effects when co-administered with IR3535. CONCLUSION Our findings confirmed that IR3535 directly activates bitter-sensing GRNs, which are mediated by GR47a. This relatively safe and highly potent insecticide can be largely used in combination with DEET to increase its efficiency to protect livestock and crops. Collectively, our findings suggest that the molecular sensors elucidated herein could be used as targets for the development of alternative insecticides. This article is protected by copyright.

Flies choose the sweeter non-nutritive sugar, L-glucose, over the nutritive D-glucose if they are not starved. However, under starvation conditions, they switch their preference to D-glucose, and this occurs independent of peripheral taste neurons. Here, we found that eliminating the TRPγ channel impairs the ability of starved flies to choose D-glucose. This food selection depends on trpγ expression in neurosecretory cells in the brain that express diuretic hormone 44 (DH44). Loss of trpγ increases feeding, alters the physiology of the crop, which is the fly stomach equivalent, and decreases intracellular sugars and glycogen levels. Moreover, survival of starved trpγ flies is reduced. Expression of trpγ in DH44 neurons reverses these deficits.

Important monitoring tasks include land use and land cover classification, change detection, forest monitoring and crop type identification, among others. To develop accurate solutions for RS-based applications, often supervised shallow/deep learning algorithms are used. However, such approaches usually require fixed-length inputs and large labeled datasets. Unfortunately, RS images acquired by optical sensors are frequently degraded by aerosol contamination, clouds and cloud shadows, resulting in missing observations and irregular observation patterns. To address these issues, efforts have been made to implement frameworks that generate meaningful representations from the irregularly sampled data streams and alleviate the deficiencies of the data sources and supervised algorithms. Here, we propose a conceptually and computationally simple representation learning (RL) approach based on autoencoders (AEs) to generate discriminative features for crop type classification. The proposed methodology includes a set of single-layer AEs with a very limited number of neurons, each one trained with the mono-temporal spectral features of a small set of samples belonging to a class, resulting in a model capable of processing very large areas in a short computational time. Importantly, the developed approach remains flexible with respect to the availability of clear temporal observations. The signal derived from the ensemble of AEs is the reconstruction difference vector between input samples and their corresponding estimations, which are averaged over all cloud-/shadow-free temporal observations of a pixel location. This averaged reconstruction difference vector is the base for the representations and the subsequent classification. Experimental results show that the proposed extremely light-weight architecture indeed generates separable features for competitive performances in crop type classification, as distance metrics scores achieved with the derived representations significantly outperform those obtained with the initial data. Conventional classification models were trained and tested with representations generated from a widely used Sentinel-2 multi-spectral multi-temporal dataset, BreizhCrops. Our method achieved 77.06% overall accuracy, which is ∼6% higher than that achieved using original Sentinel-2 data within conventional classifiers and even ∼4% better than complex deep models such as OmnisCNN. Compared to extremely complex and time-consuming models such as Transformer and long short-term memory (LSTM), only a 3% reduction in overall accuracy was noted. Our method uses only 6.8k parameters, i.e., ∼400x fewer than OmnicsCNN and ∼27x fewer than Transformer. The results prove that our method is competitive in terms of classification performance compared with state-of-the-art methods while substantially reducing the computational load.",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17030378,

We demonstrate that loss of FruM from D. subobscura IPCs abrogates neurite extension and gift giving, whereas FruM overexpression in their D. melanogaster counterparts induces overgrowth of neurites that harbor functional synapses, culminating in increased regurgitation.

Thus, in this present in vivo study, we investigated this possibility by intraperitoneally (i.p.) administering 3.5 mg OTA/kg body weight to adult male mice to assess whether chronic exposure to this mycotoxin negatively affects cell viability in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.

In the present study, RNA-seq was performed with RNA samples extracted from the legs of 1-, 10-, and 20-d-old workers of Apis cerana cerana Fabricius, a dominant indigenous crop pollinator with a keen perception ability for phytochemicals. A total of 124 candidate chemosensory proteins (CSPs), including 15 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 5 CSPs, 7 gustatory receptors (GRs), 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), and 95 odorant receptors (ORs), were identified from the assembled leg transcriptome. In silico analysis of expression showed that 36 of them were differentially expressed among the three different ages of A. c. cerana workers. Overall, the genes encoding OBPs and CSPs had great but extremely variable FPKM values and thus were highly expressed in the legs of workers, whereas the genes encoding ORs, GRs, and SNMPs (except SNMP2) were expressed at low levels. Tissue-specific expression patterns indicated that two upregulated genes, AcerOBP15 and AcerCSP3, were predominately expressed in the legs of 20-d-old foragers, suggesting they may play an essential role in gustatory recognition and selection of plant nectars and pollens.

Chemical investigations, by spectroscopic and chemical methods, led to the identification of different long chain primary alcohols (LCOHs) of the general formula R-OH, wherein R is a long, unbranched, unsubstituted, linear aliphatic group. LCOHs have been reported as components of lepidopteran pheromone blends, but their phagodeterrent effect to aphids is herein reported for the first time. The effects of LCOHs on R. padi were studied by behavioral and electrophysiological bioassays. Feeding preference tests that were carried out with winged and wingless morphs of R. padi showed that LCOHs had high phagodeterrent activity and restrained aphids from settling on treated leaves at a concentration as low as 0.15 mM (0.036 g/l). The results of different electrophysiological analyses indicated that taste receptor neurons located on the aphid tarsomeres were involved in the LCOHs perception. Behavioral assays carried out with some commercial agrochemicals, including azadirachtin A, pyrethrum and a mineral oil-based product, in combination with 1-hexadecanol, the LCOH most abundantly produced by T. citrinoviride ITEM 4484, showed that these different active principles could be applied together, resulting in a useful increase of the phagodeterrent effect.

Based on the segmentation and recognition of medical images, this paper proposes a neural network and image saliency based on the obvious difference between the heart image and other tissues in the slice, and the high similarity between adjacent slices in the CT image sequence. Fully automatic segmentation algorithm and 3D visual reconstruction is the segmented heart image. Convolutional neural network is a special deep neural network model of artificial intelligence. Its connections between neurons are not fully connected. The weights of connections between certain neurons in the same layer are shared, and the network model is reduced. The complexity reduces the number of weights. The use of visual saliency techniques to achieve cardiac segmentation based on CT images. An image saliency detection algorithm is adopted to introduce the image segmentation algorithm based on the saliency technique. In this paper, considering the PET image as grayscale image with low resolution, an improved Itti model and an improved GrabCut image segmentation algorithm are proposed to solve the problem of the original algorithm in grayscale image. At the same time, the operation steps of the user division area are cancelled, and the automatic processing is realized, and the running time of the algorithm is improved while optimizing the image segmentation effect. The convolutional neural network is constructed to realize the positioning function of the heart in the image. The original cardiac CT image is cropped by the positioning result, and some non-target areas are removed. A stacking noise reduction self-coding network is constructed, and the network is manually segmented. Training, realize the classification and recognition of the pixels belonging to the heart tissue in the CT image of the heart, and finally realize the segmentation of the heart image based on the classification result. The results of the above segmentation algorithm are quantitatively evaluated and analyzed with the artificial segmentation results, and the segmentation results are visually reconstructed by surface rendering and volume rendering. The algorithm has better accuracy, reliability and higher. The segmentation efficiency is more simplified for user operations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09076675.pdf,
