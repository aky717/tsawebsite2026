Modern farming employs technology to improve productivity. Early and accurate analysis and diagnosis of plant disease is very helpful in reducing plant diseases and improving plant health and food crop productivity. Plant disease experts are not available in remote areas thus there is a requirement of automatic low-cost, approachable and reliable solutions to identify the plant diseases without the laboratory inspection and expert’s opinion. Deep learning-based computer vision techniques like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and traditional machine learning-based image classification approaches are being applied to identify plant diseases. In this paper, the CNN model is proposed for the classification of rice and potato plant leaf diseases. Rice leaves are diagnosed with bacterial blight, blast, brown spot and tungro diseases. Potato leaf images are classified into three classes: healthy leaves, early blight and late blight diseases. Rice leaf datasetwith 5932 images and 1500 potato leaf images are used in the study. The proposed CNN model was able to learn hidden patterns from the raw images and classify rice images with 99.58% accuracy and potato leaves with 97.66% accuracy. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN model performed better when compared with other machine learning image classifiers such as Support VectorMachine (SVM),K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),Decision Tree and Random Forest.","Accurately detecting disease occurrences of crops in early stage is essential for quality and yield of crops through the decision of an appropriate treatments. However, detection of disease needs specialized knowledge and long-term experiences in plant pathology. Thus, an automated system for disease detecting in crops will play an important role in agriculture by constructing early detection system of disease. To develop this system, construction of a stepwise disease detection model using images of diseased-healthy plant pairs and a CNN algorithm consisting of five pre-trained models. The disease detection model consists of three step classification models, crop classification, disease detection, and disease classification. The ‘unknown’ is added into categories to generalize the model for wide application. In the validation test, the disease detection model classified crops and disease types with high accuracy (97.09%). The low accuracy of non-model crops was improved by adding these crops to the training dataset implicating expendability of the model. Our model has the potential to apply to smart farming of Solanaceae crops and will be widely used by adding more various crops as training dataset.","Global food security depends on tomato growing, but several fungal, bacterial, and viral illnesses seriously reduce productivity and quality, therefore causing major financial losses. Reducing these impacts depends on early, exact diagnosis of diseases. This work provides a deep learning-based ensemble model for tomato leaf disease classification combining MobileNetV2 and ResNet50. To improve feature extraction, the models were tweaked by changing their output layers with GlobalAverage Pooling2D, Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Dense layers. To take use of their complimentary qualities, the feature maps from both models were combined. This study uses a publicly available dataset from Kaggle for tomato leaf disease classification. Training on a dataset of 11,000 annotated pictures spanning 10 disease categories, including bacterial spot, early blight, late blight, leaf mold, septoria leaf spot, spider mites, target spot, yellow leaf curl virus, mosaic virus, and healthy leaves. Data preprocessing included image resizing and splitting, along with an 80-10-10 split, allocating 80% for training, 10% for testing, and 10% for validation to ensure a balanced evaluation. The proposed model with a 99.91% test accuracy, the suggested model was quite remarkable. Furthermore, guaranteeing strong classification performance across all disease categories, the model showed great precision (99.92%), recall (99.90%), and an F1-score of 99.91%. With few misclassifications, the confusion matrix verified almost flawless classification even further. These findings show how well deep learning can automate tomato disease diagnosis, therefore providing a scalable and quite accurate solution for smart agriculture. By means of early intervention and precision agriculture techniques, the suggested strategy has the potential to improve crop health monitoring, reduce economic losses, and encourage sustainable farming practices.","—Agriculture and modern farming is one of the fields where IoT and automation can have a great impact. Maintaining healthy plants and monitoring their environment in order to identify or detect diseases is essential in order to maintain a maximum crop yield. The implementation of current high rocketing technologies including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning has proved to be extremely important in modern agriculture as a method of advanced image analysis domain. Artificial intelligence adds time efficiency and the possibility of identifying plant diseases, in addition to monitoring and controlling the environmental conditions in farms. Several studies showed that machine learning and deep learning technologies can detect plant diseases upon analyzing plant leaves with great accuracy and sensitivity. In this study, considering the worth of machine learning for disease detection, we present a convolutional neural network VGG-16 model to detect plant diseases, to allow farmers to make timely actions with respect to treatment without further delay. To carry this out, 19 different classes of plants diseases were chosen, where 15,915 plant leaf images (both diseased and healthy leaves) were acquired from the Plant Village dataset for training and testing. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model is able to achieve an accuracy of about 95.2% with the testing loss being only 0.4418. The proposed model provides a clear direction toward a deep learning-based plant disease detection to apply on a large scale in future.","The automated recognition of disease in tomato leaves can greatly enhance yield and allow farmers to manage challenges more efficiently. This study investigates the performance of YOLOv11 for tomato leaf disease recognition. All accessible versions of YOLOv11 were first fine-tuned on an improved tomato leaf disease dataset consisting of a healthy class and 10 disease classes. YOLOv11m was selected for further hyperparameter optimization based on its evaluation metrics. It achieved a fitness score of 0.98885, with a precision of 0.99104, a recall of 0.98597, and a mAP@.5 of 0.99197. This model underwent rigorous hyperparameter optimization using the one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) algorithm, with a focus on essential parameters such as batch size, learning rate, optimizer, weight decay, momentum, dropout, and epochs. Subsequently, random search (RS) with 100 configurations was performed based on the results of OFAT. Among them, the C47 model demonstrated a fitness score of 0.99268 (a 0.39% improvement), with a precision of 0.99190 (0.09%), a recall of 0.99348 (0.76%), and a mAP@.5 of 0.99262 (0.07%). The results suggest that the final model works efficiently and is capable of accurately detecting and identifying tomato leaf diseases, making it suitable for practical farming applications.","Cassava is a vital sustenance crop for millions of individuals around the globe, especially in developing nations. However, cassava production is threatened by various leaf maladies that can drastically reduce productivity. Effective management and prevention of these diseases require early detection and diagnosis. This study devised a federated learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the classification of five cassava leaf disease classes: Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), Cassava Green Mottle (CGM), Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), and Healthy. The proposed model showed promising performance on a dataset of 9,465 images, with precision values between 0.74 and 0.85, recall values between 0.70 and 0.88, and overall accuracy of 78.6%. This study's federated learning approach offers several advantages, including data privacy, scalability, and continuous learning, making it suitable for real-world cassava leaf disease classification applications. In addition, this study demonstrates the potential for utilizing advanced machine learning techniques in the agricultural sector to improve early disease detection and support sustainable farming practices.","In India, about 70% of the population is involved in agriculture and farming. Today plant diseases are significant concern as it reduces the production and quality of agriculture produce. Most plant diseases are caused by bacteria, fungi and virus. Manual detection and identification of leaf disease involve more man power and expensive in large farm. Detection of disease and healthy monitoring of plant are major challenges for sustainable agriculture. Hence there is need to detect plant disease automatically using image processing technique at an early stage with more accuracy. It involves image acquisition, image pre-processing, image segmentation, feature extraction and classification of disease. To increase the quality of produce and yield, a regular monitoring technique for detection of diseases in plants becomes essential. The digital image processing system is one such powerful technique to diagnose the difficult symptoms much earlier than the human eye could recognize. It enables the farmers to take appropriate actions timely in order to safeguard the crop and get the desired quality and yield of agriculture produce. Different techniques used for the classification of plant disease using various classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network , K-Nearest Neighbors and other classifier methods have been discussed. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of established methods for plant disease detection, classification systems.","Crop diseases pose a significant threat to global food security, with both economic and environmental consequences. Early and accurate detection is essential for timely intervention and sustainable farming. This paper presents a review of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for crop disease diagnosis, focusing on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs), and deep models like VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. The review method includes an in-depth analysis of algorithm performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score across various datasets. We also highlight the data imbalances in commonly used datasets, particularly PlantVillage, and discuss the challenges posed by these imbalances. The research highlights critical insights regarding ML and DL models in crop disease detection. A primary challenge identified is the imbalance in the PlantVillage dataset, with a high number of healthy images and a strong bias toward certain disease categories like fungi, leaving other categories like mites and molds underrepresented. This imbalance complicates model generalization, indicating a need for preprocessing steps to enhance performance. This study also shows that combining Vision Transformers (ViTs) with Green Chromatic Coordinates and hybridizing these with SVM achieves high classification accuracy, emphasizing the value of advanced feature extraction techniques in improving model efficacy. In terms of comparative performance, DL architectures like ResNet50, VGG16, and convolutional neural network demonstrated robust accuracy (95–99%) across diverse datasets, underscoring their effectiveness in managing complex image data. Additionally, traditional ML models exhibited varied strengths; for instance, SVM performed better on balanced datasets, while RF excelled with imbalanced data. Preprocessing methods like K-means clustering, Fuzzy C-Means, and PCA, along with ensemble approaches, further improved model accuracy. Lastly, the study underscores that high-quality, well-labeled datasets, stakeholder involvement, and comprehensive evaluation metrics such as F1 score and precision are crucial for optimizing ML and DL models, making them more effective for real-world applications in sustainable agriculture.","Agriculture is the primary source of economic development in India. The fertility of soil, weather conditions, and crop economic values make farmers select appropriate crops for every season. To meet the increasing population requirements, agricultural industries look for improved means of food production. Researchers are in search of new technologies that would reduce investment and significantly improve the yields. Precision is a new technology that helps in improving farming techniques. Pest and weed detection and plant leaf disease detection are the noteworthy applications of precision agriculture. The main aim of this paper is to identify the diseased and healthy leaves of distinct plants by extracting features from input images using CNN algorithm. These features extracted help in identifying the most relevant class for images from the datasets. The authors have observed that the proposed system consumes an average time of 3.8 seconds for identifying the image class with more than 94.5% accuracy.","Advancements in technology, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), greatly impact agriculture. The study investigates the statistical applications of AI-driven robotic devices based on the IoT as a basic emphasis. Using manual effort and chemical fertilizers, traditional farming can be highly attributed to inefficiency, health problems and environmental effects. The paper proposes an AgriBotIQ, a revolutionary platform that uses robotics based on IoT to monitor and analyse with accurate participation in plant management. Autonomous robots can collect information based on plants and their habitats by using imaging devices and sensors like soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and many others. Machine learning (ML) algorithms search the database for anomaly detection, threats, and crop trends. To identify the crops that are diseased or healthy, ML is integrated with computer vision. The suggested AgriBotIQ also eliminated weeds, boosting the output by neglecting unneeded waste and chemicals. The emerging IoTs have allowed better remote plant monitoring in more versatile and précised. Overall productivity and protection of crops are possible by statistical analysis and real-time notifications of the proactive decisionmaking outcomes. By combining IoT and AI, the future agricultural crop security will improve greatly.",16.7449520150831,Diagnostic Accuracy Improvement

This is clearly unsustainable, and the amount of land we protect for nature needs to be increased and preserved. However, this still leaves vast regions of the world unprotected and modified. Such landscapes do not have to be a lost cause. Kremen and Merenlender review how biodiversity-based techniques can be used to manage most human-modified lands as “working landscapes.” These can provide for human needs and maintain biodiversity not just for ecosystem services but also for maintenance and persistence of nonhuman species. Science, this issue p. eaau6020 BACKGROUND Biodiversity is under siege, with greatly enhanced rates of local and global extinction and the decline of once-abundant species. Current rates of human-induced climate change and land use forecast the Anthropocene as one of the most devastating epochs for life on earth. How do we handle the Anthropocene’s triple challenge of preventing biodiversity loss, mitigating and adapting to climate change, and sustainably providing resources for a growing human population? The answer is in how we manage Earth’s “working lands”; that is, farms, forests, and rangelands. These lands must be managed both to complement the biodiversity conservation goals of protected areas and to maintain the diverse communities of organisms, from microbes to mammals, that contribute to producing food, materials, clean water, and healthy soils; sequestering greenhouse gases; and buffering extreme weather events, functions that are essential for all life on Earth. ADVANCES Protected areas are the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation. Although the total area of protected regions needs to be increased, parks will nonetheless continue to lose species if these areas are isolated from one another by inhospitable land uses and are faced with a rapidly changing climate. Further, many species, such as those that migrate, remain unprotected as they occupy lands outside of parks for all or portions of their life cycles. Lastly, protected-area effectiveness is greatly influenced by surrounding land management. “Working lands conservation” aims to support biodiversity while providing goods and services for humanity over the long term, assuring sustainability and resilience. By managing lands surrounding parks favorably, working lands can buffer protected areas from threats and connect them to one another. This approach complements protected areas by providing accessory habitats and resources for some species while facilitating dispersal and climate change adaptation for others. Further, by maintaining the biodiversity that supplies critical ecosystem services within working lands, these approaches ensure that the production of food, fiber, fuel, and timber can be sustained over the long run and be more resilient to extreme events, such as floods, droughts, hurricanes, and pest and disease outbreaks, which are becoming more frequent with climate change. A variety of biodiversity-based land management techniques can be used in working lands, including agroforestry, silvopasture, diversified farming, and ecosystem-based forest management, to ensure sustainable production of food and fiber. OUTLOOK The underlying principle of biodiversity-based management of working lands has been practiced since ancient times. Today, these systems have largely been replaced by unsustainable resource extraction, rather than serving as models that could be adapted to modern conditions. Although various regulatory, voluntary, and financial tools exist to promote sustainable land management, many barriers prevent individuals, communities, and corporations from adopting biodiversity-based practices, including deeply entrenched policy and market conditions that favor industrialized or extractive models of land use. Thus, uptake of these approaches has been patchy and slow and is not yet sufficient to create change at the temporal and spatial scales needed to face the triple Anthropocene threat. Biodiversity-based land management practices are knowledge- rather than technology-intensive. They are well adapted to empower local communities to manage their natural resources. One of the most exciting emerging trends is community-driven initiatives to manage working landscapes for conservation and sustainability. By linking up through grassroots organizations, social movements, and public-private partnerships, these initiatives can scale up to create collective impact and can demand changes in government policies to facilitate the conservation of working lands. Scientists and conservation practitioners can support these initiatives by engaging with the public, listening to alternative ways of knowing, and cocreating landscapes that work for biodiversity and people.

On the left, a homogeneous landscape of strawberry monoculture, including organic fields, supports fewer wild species then a diversified, organic farm (right) in the same region, which includes a small field of strawberry, surrounded by orchards, hedgerows, diverse vegetable crops, and natural habitats. The monoculture landscape creates barriers to wildlife dispersal, whereas the diversified landscape is more permeable. PHOTO: C. KREMEN How can we manage farmlands, forests, and rangelands to respond to the triple challenge of the Anthropocene—biodiversity loss, climate change, and unsustainable land use? When managed by using biodiversity-based techniques such as agroforestry, silvopasture, diversified farming, and ecosystem-based forest management, these socioeconomic systems can help maintain biodiversity and provide habitat connectivity, thereby complementing protected areas and providing greater resilience to climate change. Simultaneously, the use of these management techniques can improve yields and profitability more sustainably, enhancing livelihoods and food security. This approach to “working lands conservation” can create landscapes that work for nature and people. However, many socioeconomic challenges impede the uptake of biodiversity-based land management practices. Although improving voluntary incentives, market instruments, environmental regulations, and governance is essential to support working lands conservation, it is community action, social movements, and broad coalitions among citizens, businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies that have the power to transform how we manage land and protect the environment.","Climate change has an effect on ecosystems and people all around the globe and causes land degradation. A long‐term decline in biological output, loss of ecological integrity, and a fall in the economic worth of the land are all signs of “land degradation”, a downbeat trend in land condition. In the red lateritic zone of the tropical area, where “climate change” and “land degradation” are related, they impact one another. On the other hand, due to the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which slow the rate of carbon absorption, and the extent of various existing land degradation processes, which are worsened in pace and magnitude by “climate change”. The world's expanding population poses a challenge to supplying the rising demand for food in recent decades. The need for additional land for farming, feed, and other forms of production is fuelled by poverty and the destruction of the environment. In tropical regions, “soil erosion” caused by “water and wind, salinization and alkalinity, acidity, losses of organic carbon, nutrient imbalance, pollution/contamination by toxic substances, and soil sealing and capping” all call for immediate action to stop the land degradation process and sustainably restore productivity for environmental security and food security for the world's expanding population. After fulfilling the requirement systematic knowledge about soil, scientific use of natural resources (water, land, minerals, vegetation, air and biodiversity) will present a healthy planet with a healthy ecological system for future generations.","A key challenge for humanity is how a future global population of 9 billion can all be fed healthily and sustainably. Here, we review how competition for land is influenced by other drivers and pressures, examine land-use change over the past 20 years and consider future changes over the next 40 years. Competition for land, in itself, is not a driver affecting food and farming in the future, but is an emergent property of other drivers and pressures. Modelling studies suggest that future policy decisions in the agriculture, forestry, energy and conservation sectors could have profound effects, with different demands for land to supply multiple ecosystem services usually intensifying competition for land in the future. In addition to policies addressing agriculture and food production, further policies addressing the primary drivers of competition for land (population growth, dietary preference, protected areas, forest policy) could have significant impacts in reducing competition for land. Technologies for increasing per-area productivity of agricultural land will also be necessary. Key uncertainties in our projections of competition for land in the future relate predominantly to uncertainties in the drivers and pressures within the scenarios, in the models and data used in the projections and in the policy interventions assumed to affect the drivers and pressures in the future.","New approaches to ocean governance for coastal communities are needed. With few exceptions, the status quo does not meet the diverse development aspirations of coastal communities or ensure healthy oceans for current and future generations. The blue economy is expected to grow to USD2.5–3 trillion by 2030, and there is particular interest in its potential to alleviate poverty in Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, and to support a blue recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a selective, thematic review of the blue economy literature to examine: (i) the opportunities and risks for coastal communities, (ii) the barriers and enablers that shape community engagement, and (iii) the strategies employed by communities and supporting organizations, which can be strengthened to deliver a ‘sustainable' blue economy and improve social justice for coastal communities. Our review finds that under business-as-usual and blue growth, industrial fisheries, large-scale aquaculture, land reclamation, mining, and oil and gas raise red flags for communities and marine ecosystems. Whereas, if managed sustainably, small-scale fisheries, coastal aquaculture, seaweed farming and eco-tourism are the most likely to deliver benefits to communities. Yet, these are also the sectors most vulnerable to negative and cumulative impacts from other sectors. Based on our evaluation of enablers, barriers and strategies, the paper argues that putting coastal communities at the center of a clear vision for an inclusive Sustainable Blue Economy and co-developing a shared and accessible language for communities, practitioners and policy-makers is essential for a more equitable ocean economy, alongside mainstreaming social justice principles and integrated governance that can bridge different scales of action and opportunity.","Improved knowledge on the swimming physiology of fish and its application to fisheries science and aquaculture (i.e., farming a fitter fish) is currently needed in the face of global environmental changes, high fishing pressures, increased aquaculture production as well as increased concern on fish well-being. Here, we review existing data on teleost fish that indicate that sustained exercise at optimal speeds enhances muscle growth and has consequences for flesh quality. Potential added benefits of sustained exercise may be delay of ovarian development and stimulation of immune status. Exercise could represent a natural, noninvasive, and economical approach to improve growth, flesh quality as well as welfare of aquacultured fish: a FitFish for a healthy consumer. All these issues are important for setting directions for policy decisions and future studies in this area. For this purpose, the FitFish workshop on the Swimming Physiology of Fish (http://www.ub.edu/fitfish2010) was organized to bring together a multidisciplinary group of scientists using exercise models, industrial partners, and policy makers. Sixteen international experts from Europe, North America, and Japan were invited to present their work and view on migration of fishes in their natural environment, beneficial effects of exercise, and applications for sustainable aquaculture. Eighty-eight participants from 19 different countries contributed through a poster session and round table discussion. Eight papers from invited speakers at the workshop have been contributed to this special issue on The Swimming Physiology of Fish.","Though aquaculture plays an important role in providing foods and healthy diets, there are concerns regarding the environmental sustainability of prevailing practices. This study examines the trends and changes in fisheries originating from aquaculture production in Thailand and provides insights into such production’s environmental impacts and sustainability. Together with an extensive literature review, we investigated a time series of Thai aquaculture production data from 1995 to 2015. Overall, Thai aquaculture production has significantly increased during the last few decades and significantly contributed to socio-economic development. Estimates of total aquaculture production in Thailand have gradually grown from around 0.6 to 0.9 million tons over the last twenty years. Farmed shrimp is the main animal aquatic product, accounting for an estimated 40% of total yields of aquaculture production, closely followed by fish (38%) and mollusk (22%). Estimates over the past decades indicate that around 199470 ha of land is used for aquaculture farming. Out of the total area, 61% is used for freshwater farms, and 39% is used for coastal farms. However, this industry has contributed to environmental degradation, such as habitat destruction, water pollution, and ecological effects. Effective management strategies are urgently needed to minimize the environmental impacts of aquaculture and to ensure it maximally contributes to planetary health. Innovative and practical solutions that rely on diverse technology inputs and smart market-based management approaches that are designed for environmentally friendly aquaculture farming can be the basis for viable long-term solutions for the future.","Healthy soil is the foundation underpinning global agriculture and food security. Soil erosion is currently the most serious threat to soil health, leading to yield decline, ecosystem degradation and economic impacts. Here, we provide high-resolution (ca. 100 × 100 m) global estimates of soil displacement by water erosion obtained using the Revised-Universal-Soil-Loss-Equation-based Global Soil Erosion Modelling (GloSEM) platform under present (2019) and future (2070) climate scenarios (i.e. Shared Socioeconomic Pathway [SSP]1–Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP]2.6, SSP2–RCP4.5 and SSP5–RCP8.5). GloSEM is the first global modelling platform to take into account regional farming systems, the mitigation effects of conservation agriculture (CA), and climate change projections. We provide a set of data, maps and descriptive statistics to support researchers and decision-makers in exploring the extent and geography of soil erosion, identifying probable hotspots, and exploring (with stakeholders) appropriate actions for mitigating impacts. In this regard, we have also provided an Excel spreadsheet that can provide useful insights into the potential mitigating effects of present and future alternative CA scenarios at the country level.

Land degradation has occurred in the Ethiopian highlands as a result of modifications in LULC caused by poor farming methods, high livestock population, and human pressures. Most researchers identified the many LULC drivers and their impact on floristic composition. All of these manifestations have the potential to have major consequences for land users and individuals whose livelihoods rely on the products of a healthy environment. This change in LULC type, combined with poor land management practices in Ethiopia, puts land in jeopardy of erosion, resulting in accelerated soil degradation. All LULC variables, such as the spread of various agricultural activities, the production of fuelwood and charcoal, cutting trees for construction resources, settlements, and revenue growth, are associated with population increase and resettlement. In Ethiopia, the lack of a relevant forest policy implementation on the ground is recognized as a cause pushing deforestation and other landscape changes. This review paper aimed to compile the effects of land use land cover changes on Ethiopian vegetation.","Research and practice during the last 20 years has shown that urban agriculture can contribute to minimising the effects of climate change by, at the same time, improving quality of life in urban areas. In order to do so most effectively, land use and spatial planning are crucial so as to obtain and maintain a supportive green infrastructure and to secure citizens' healthy living conditions. As people today trend more towards living in green and sustainable city centres that can offer fresh and locally produced food, cities become again places for growing food. The scope of urban agriculture thereby is to establish food production sites within the city's sphere; for example, through building-integrated agriculture including concepts such as aquaponics, indoor agriculture, vertical farming, rooftop production, edible walls, as well as through urban farms, edible landscapes, school gardens and community gardens. Embedded in changing urban food systems, the contribution of urban agriculture to creating sustainable and climate-friendly cities is pivotal as it has the capacity to integrate other resource streams such as water, waste and energy. This article describes some of the current aspects of the circular city debate where urban agriculture is pushing forward the development of material and resource cycling in cities.",10.6567624989818,Climate Change and Health

The cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000–8,000 years ago in the Near East. Yeast is one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the discovery of alcoholic drinks such as wine. It is very important fruits and give more income to farmers than the other crops. Seeing to its importance, the present study was carried out since May, 2020. The universe of the study was the world. The major objective was to review the grape production in the world. Secondary day was used and total 31 articles were downloaded from the net and critically reviewed in depth and result was concluded. The result indicated that grapes are grown over the whole world. China, France, United America, South Africa, Italy, Chile, Iran, Turkey, Spain and Argentina are top ten countries in the world. In 2017 the China production was 13,083,000 tones and the South Africa was 2,032,582. The China production was on the top while the South Africa Production was at the 10th number in the world. Similarly the world top ten varieties are Cabernet Sauvignon which is grown on 840,000 acres area in the world while Merlot area is 657,300 acres. Similarly the Tempranillo area is 570,800 acres Airen, 538 700 acres, Chardonnay 518,900 acres, Syrah, 470 000 acres. The Grenache Noir area is 402,780 acres, Sauvignon Blanc, 299 000 acres, Pinot Noir, 285,000 acres , Trebbiano Toscano / Ugni Blanc, 274,300 acres. Airen is a white grape used a lot in Spain, often for quite unpretentious wines. Tempranillo is also Spanish but more famous, especially if you are a fan of Rioja. Tempranillo and Airen are very dominant in Spain. They are planted on almost 45% of the Spanish Vineland. Rrebbiano in Italy is the same as Ugni Blanc in France. In Italy, it is responsible for many white wines of rather a bland character. In France, it is used for Cognac and the producers there like it precisely for its blandness. But it does make a good Cognac. Grapes are grown in all countries of the world and give more money than the other crops to farmers. In Pakistan in the Area of Shekhpura one farmer told that it give 14 times more income than the wheat. In Pakistan it is mostly grown in Baluchistan while in Sind area some projects are working for grape production enhancement. Similarly grape has some essential elements which play great role in health problems. From grapes wines are prepared which give more income to European countries. It needs very less water till maturity. It has two types namely table grapes and non table grapes in the world. It also help in diabetes and blood pressures while play great role in heart problems. In France more people use grapes so there the problems of heart is very less than the other countries. Resvratrol also present in the grape which has anti-cancer properties and is very healthy for the glands and large intestine. “It is also beneficial to combat heart diseases, diseases of the nervous system, Alzheimer’s disease, viral infections and fungal infections. Resveratrol reduces the risk of paralysis by improving the molecular mechanism in the veins. So the discussion shows that grape is very important fruit of the world while sometime it is called king of the fruit. .According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 75,866 square kilometres of the world are dedicated to grapes. Approximately 71% of world grape production is used for wine, 27% as fresh fruit, and 2% as dried fruit. Raw grapes are 81% water, 18% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and have negligible fat. The farmers of the world are very poor and have no access to credit , so it is requested of the world bank to give proper loan to the world farmer for grapes grown, to in time purchase the inputs and in time marketed to the consumers in the world to earn money for their farming uplifting. Some pest also attacked on the grape and decreases the production of the farmer. The grape leaf hopper is the common insect pest feed on the vines from the time leaves appear in the spring until they drop in the fall. They remove the green chlorophyll, and the whole leaf may become pale, die and turn brown. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease prevalent on grapes. Any portion of plant such as leaves, blossom, fruit and young shoots may be affected. A white patch appearance may be noted on leaves young shoots; blossom fails to set fruit. Young berries attacked by this fungus may drop, or become hardened, discolored and cracked. To control powdery mildew apply fungicides before symptoms appear. Root knot caused by a gall-forming nematode may become a problem in sandy and sandy loam soil, resulting in a decline in vine vigor and reduction in yields. Resistant root-stocks should be used for grape production. Through fumigation the disease of the grapes should be controlled. So it is the duty of the government to controls the mentioned problems in their countries for enhancing of grape production. Every government should focus on this fruit and arrange propagation program in their countries because it give more benefit to the farmers instead of Wheat. Through this way industries will be developed and employment will be generated which play great role in the solution of unemployment problem in the country. In European countries the government mostly focuses on this fruit while in developing countries the program for grape is very slow, so it is the duty of every government in the world to spend more money on grape for enhancing grape industries in the developing countries. They are very poor and they have no access to credit and because of less money they did not start the grape program on their farm.","UNLABELLED With the aim of identifying health-relevant exposures in buildings, an epidemiological study ""Dampness in Buildings and Health"" (DBH) started in the year 2000 in Sweden. The health focus of the study is on asthma and allergic symptoms among small children and their parents. The first step in the study was an epidemiological cross-sectional questionnaire on housing and health involving 14,077 preschool children in the county of Värmland in Sweden (March-April 2000). Self-reported moisture-related problems in the building were strongly associated with asthma, allergic symptoms, and airway infections among children and adults. Other factors associated with symptoms among the children were allergic heredity, smoking in the family, male sex, urban living, short breast feeding, pet keeping, daycare attendance, non-farming life and some food habits. The second step in the study was a nested case-control study including 198 children with symptoms and 202 healthy controls. A detailed clinical examination by physicians in parallel with extensive inspections and measurements in the subjects' homes were conducted from October 2001 to April 2002. The influence of selection bias in case-control studies has been studied, and questionnaires on self-reported symptoms and building characteristics have been validated. Identified risk factors for allergic symptoms are, e.g., inspector-observed dampness, a low ventilation rate, endotoxin, Penicillium and phthalates in dust. In the third phase, a 5-year follow-up study will be carried out during 2005. The same questionnaire as used in DBH-phase 1 will be distributed to the 10,852 children/parents who responded to the first questionnaire in 2000. Finally, in a fourth phase, controlled experimental studies in climate chambers and in vitro tests regarding findings from DBH-Phase 2 are planned to be conducted during 2004-08. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Asthma and allergies among small children are associated with a number of risk factors in the indoor environment. In investigations of building-related health problems many factors have to be considered, including ""dampness"" emissions from building materials, and ventilation rates.","Growing plants in the gulf region can be challenging as it is mostly desert, and the climate is dry. A few species of plants have the capability to grow in such a climate. However, those plants are not suitable as a food source. The aim of this work is to design and construct an indoor automatic vertical hydroponic system that does not depend on the outside climate. The designed system is capable to grow common type of crops that can be used as a food source inside homes without the need of large space. The design of the system was made after studying different types of vertical hydroponic systems in terms of price, power consumption and suitability to be built as an indoor automated system. A microcontroller was working as a brain of the system, which communicates with different types of sensors to control all the system parameters and to minimize the human intervention. An open internet of things (IoT) platform was used to store and display the system parameters and graphical interface for remote access. The designed system is capable of maintaining healthy growing parameters for the plants with minimal input from the user. The functionality of the overall system was confirmed by evaluating the response from individual system components and monitoring them in the IoT platform. The system was consuming 120.59 and 230.59 kWh respectively without and with air conditioning control during peak summer, which is equivalent to the system running cost of 13.26 and 25.36 Qatari Riyal (QAR) respectively. This system was circulating around 104 k gallons of nutrient solution monthly however, only 8–10 L water was consumed by the system. This system offers real-time notifications to alert the hydroponic system user when the conditions are not favorable. So, the user can monitor several parameters without using laboratory instruments, which will allow to control the entire system remotely. Moreover, the system also provides a wide range of information, which could be essential for plant researchers and provides a greater understanding of how the key parameters of hydroponic system correlate with plant growth. The proposed platform can be used both for quantitatively optimizing the setup of the indoor farming and for automating some of the most labor-intensive maintenance activities. Moreover, such a monitoring system can also potentially be used for high-level decision making, once enough data will be collected. This work presents significant opportunities for the people who live in the gulf region to produce food as per their requirements.","Domesticated in 8000–10,000 BP in northern China, proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is the best adaptive rotational crop for semiarid central High Plains of the USA, where average annual precipitation is 356–407 mm. Proso millet has multiple benefits when consumed as human food. Proso millet is rich in minerals, dietary fiber, polyphenols, vitamins and proteins. It is gluten-free and therefore, ideal for the gluten intolerant people. Proso millet contains high lecithin which supports the neural health system. It is rich in vitamins (niacin, B-complex vitamins, folic acid), minerals (P, Ca, Zn, Fe) and essential amino acids (methionine and cysteine). It has a low glycemic index and reduces the risk of type-2 diabetes. Unfortunately, in the USA, it is mostly considered as bird feed, whereas it is mainly used as human food in many other countries. Besides human health benefits, proso millet has an impeccable environmental benefit. Proso millet possesses many unique characteristics (e.g., drought tolerance, short-growing season) which makes it a promising rotational crop for winter wheat-based dryland farming systems. Proso millet provides the most economical production system when used in a two years wheat/summer fallow cropping system in semiarid High Plains of the USA. It helps in controlling winter annual grass weeds, managing disease and insect pressure and preserving deep soil moisture for wheat. Proso millet can also be used as a rotational crop with corn or sorghum owing to its tolerance for atrazine, the primary herbicide used in corn and sorghum production systems. Proso millet certainly is a climate-smart, gluten-free, ancient, and small grain cereal, which is healthy to humans and the environment. The main challenge is to expand the proso millet market beyond bird feed into the human food industry. To overcome the challenge, unique proso millet varieties for human food and ready-to-use multiple food products must be developed. This requires successful collaboration among experts from diverse disciplines such as breeders, geneticists, food chemists and food industry partners.","Fresh produce within vertical farming systems grows vertically in different layers stacked atop each other, thus allowing for the efficient use of space. As the environment in vertical farming systems is completely controlled, neither sunlight nor soil is necessary. On the one hand, vertical farming may help to provide a healthy diet for the growing global population because it has a greater crop yield per square meter used than conventional farming; moreover, it can offer the opportunity to grow food in climatically disadvantaged areas. On the other hand, growth conditions may be perceived as unnatural and the entire vertical farming system as unsustainable. Therefore, understanding the consumers’ acceptance of vertical farming systems is important. This study is the first work to provide insights into consumers’ acceptance of three different vertical farming systems. Data are collected through an online survey of 482 consumers in Germany in February 2018. Drivers of consumer acceptance of vertical farming systems are identified through structural equation modelling. The results indicate that perceived sustainability is the major driver of consumer acceptance of vertical farming systems. The larger the system, the higher the likelihood that it will be considered as sustainable. Obviously, consumers perceive something like ecologies of scale.","Simple Summary The shrimp sector has been one of the fastest-growing agri-food systems in the last 10 years. To overcome the increasing market demand, the transition to the intensification of shrimp farming is a reality in many countries. In addition, the desire to mitigate the risks posed by pathogens has driven many farmers to preference more controlled intensive systems with higher biosecurity. Shrimp nutrition and breeding are other areas that have directly enabled and improved intensification and will continue to be critical to ongoing growth in this sector. From this perspective, the aim of this review is to provide an update of the current production systems and strategies and explore the advances and key contributions that nutrition, breeding, and pathogen surveillance are having towards intensification and super-intensive shrimp culture. Abstract Intensification of the shrimp sector, also referred to as vertical expansion, has been predominately driven by consecutive incidences of global disease outbreaks, which have caused enormous economic loss for the main producer countries. A growing segment of the shrimp farming industry has opted to use production systems with higher density, biosecurity, and operating control to mitigate the risks posed by disease. However, successful super-intensive shrimp production is reliant on an advanced understanding of many important biological and economic parameters in the farming system, coupled with effective monitoring, to maintain optimal production. Compared to traditional extensive or semi-intensive systems, super-intensive systems require higher inputs of feed, energy, labor, and supplements. These systems are highly sensitive to the interactions between these different inputs and require that the biological and economical parameters of farming are carefully balanced to ensure success. Advancing nutritional knowledge and tools to support consistent and efficient production of shrimp in these high-cost super-intensive systems is also necessary. Breeding programs developing breeding-lines selected for these challenging super-intensive environments are critical. Understanding synergies between the key areas of production systems, nutrition, and breeding are crucial for super-intensive farming as all three areas coalesce to influence the health of shrimp and commercial farming success. This article reviews current strategies and innovations being used for Litopenaeus vannamei in production systems, nutrition, and breeding, and discusses the synergies across these areas that can support the production of healthy and high-quality shrimp in super-intensive systems. Finally, we briefly discuss some key issues of social license pertinent to the super-intensive shrimp farming industry.","Evaluation and monitoring systems are perceived as an effective tool to understand and improve the contribution of business activities to the accomplishment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, there is currently a lack of guidance and support on assessing the influence that the life cycle of products and services has on the SDGs. This article presents a case study where Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) is applied to understand the social performance of a textile product and its potential contribution to the SDGs. In this study, the link between the S-LCA methodology and the SDG framework was made at the indicator level, through a new classification of S-LCA indicators. This classification was aimed at indicating the positive or negative contribution of products or services into the SDGs. The method was tested with the case study of a man’s shirt whose supply chain takes place across five countries, from the cotton farming in China to the retailing in The Netherlands. The social performance of the shirt’s life cycle was analyzed through a social hotspot assessment (using PSILCA database) and a site-specific assessment following the UNEP/SETAC S-LCA guidelines. Primary data was collected for 6 different suppliers regarding 51 social indicators and four stakeholder categories (workers, local communities, value chain actors, and society). The social hotspot assessment indicated high social risks on indicators related to the following SDGs: health and well-being, affordable and clean energy, decent work, and responsible production and consumption. These risks were mainly located in Bangladesh (shirt manufacturing) and Malaysia (fabric manufacturing). The site-specific assessment indicated different results than the social risk assessment, showing worse social performance in the spinning stage (located in China). Negative scores were obtained for every supplier in at least four indicators, including working hours, safe and healthy living conditions, and access to immaterial resources. The results indicated negative social performance of the supply chain in most of the SDGs and identified points of improvement for the final retailer. The linkage of the S-LCA framework with the SDGs presented methodological challenges, mainly related to the different scope of the SDG indicators and the S-LCA indicators.","Cryptosporidium spp. is an intracellular zoonotic protozoan parasite that causes cryptosporidiosis, a diarrhoeal disease of humans and domestic animals. Transmission of Cryptosporidiosis to humans and other animals is by ingestion of oocysts of the parasite and as low as ten oocysts can cause clinical infections in otherwise healthy persons. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of Cryptosporidiosis and compare the rate of infection between free range bird and poultry bird reared in Akure South LGA, Ondo State, Nigeria. The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium reported in this study was 11.9%. Free-range birds show a higher prevalence rate 13.2% of Cryptosporidium oocysts than 10.9% in poultry birds. Aule recorded the highest prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts infection (16.1%) followed by Ipinsa (12.2%), Onigari (10%), and FUTA (8.1%). The highest prevalence 15.9% was recorded in broilers, while turkey showed no infection (0%) by Cryptosporidium. Semi-intensive system of farming was showed to be more susceptible to Cryptosporidium oocysts infection at 13.3% followed by the 12.6%, 10.3% in deep litter and battery cage. The female birds recorded higher Cryptosporidium oocysts infection (12.2%) than the male (11.6%). The study established the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts infection among studied birds in Akure South LG of Ondo State, Nigeria.","precision mean ”the quality of being clear or exact”. Farmer tries hard to get the result but we need the smart way and result oriented. The history of India’s development has been inexorably linked to that of its farmers, and the nation’s growth with that of its agronomics. Agronomics provides highest contribution to nation income. Agronomics needed top most priority because the Government and the nation would both fail to succeed if agronomics could not be successful. Today we are living in 21st century where automation is playing significant role in human life. Automation allows us to control appliances automatic control. Today industries are using automation and control machine which is high in cost and not suitable for using in a field. So as to help both government and our farmer, we can use intelligent irrigation techniques with the use of IoT (internet of things) and by building network of farmer and agriculturist to share their ideas and experience, as a full-fledged force solution to the need .this can be easily done by organizing and analysing the live and collected over time data ,allowing farmers to take pre-emptive action for healthy harvest of their crops collecting live data using sensors which are placed across the land further sent to the cloud further under taking predictive analytics to enhance crops nutrition thus using predictive analysis on data to find better solution. The IoT connected devices stream live data on the land allowing data-informed decisions on planning the resources and harvesting of farm.","Pig farming is a risk factor for increased nasal Staphylococcus aureus colonization. Using sequence typing and phylogenetic comparisons, we showed that overcolonization of farmers was caused by a few bacterial strains that were not present in nonfarmers but often caused swine infections. This finding suggests a high rate of strain exchange between pigs and farmers.",17.5726766182602,Vector-Borne Disease Control

Organic farming production system is being promoted as a low cost environment friendly production system for, improved human and soil health, better environment, and increased agricultural sustainability. The reviewed literature is in consensus that organic farming, undoubtedly, improves soil quality due to application of organic manures and composts, and adoption of legume-based diversified cropping systems. Conversely, there is also consensus on lower productivity of crops (5–58%) under organic farming than the conventional system though exceptions are there. Despite the lower crop productivity, it may become more profitable if price premiums are available on organic produce. Its role in improving nutritional quality of produce though is debatable; but owing to absence of synthetic inputs organic produce is generally considered to be safer and healthy. The organic farming practices are expected to improve the soil quality over imbalanced and discriminate use of agro-chemical inputs. In sole productivity terms, organic farming may not be a viable farming system but in terms of overall ecosystem services, the system definitely has an edge over the conventional system.","Soil is a living and dynamic body, which is prone to degradation under conventional agricultural practices. Healthy soil is one of the most important pillars of sustainability as it delivers several ecosystem services along with its control on microbial activity, nutrient recycling, and decomposition. Nature‐based solutions can play an important role in restoring soil quality for enhanced agricultural productivity and sustainability. This article discusses various nature‐based options available for improving soil quality. Indigenous practices such as sheep penning, tank silt application, green manuring, and refuse from croplands and households have the potential to restore and maintain soil fertility. Biofertilizers can add nutrients (N fixers), fixe up to 300 kg N ha through biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and facilitate (nutrient solubilizer and mobilizers) nutrient availability in the soil. Biochar, a commonly used product, can increase soil moisture availability by 8%–10% and aids in mitigating climate change through C‐sequestration. Biochar may have a climate change mitigation potential of 1.8 Pg CO2‐C equivalent per year. When added to the soil, it not only acts as a nutrient source; but also acts as a soil amendment. Biogas slurry, the effluent from biogas reactors, contains various nutrient elements that can enrich soil fertility. The holistic approach in a farming system, through integration of different enterprises, reduces dependence on off‐farm resources. Soil management through nature‐based options will maintain crop productivity and sustainability in the long run without any adverse effects on the environment.","A healthy soil acts as a dynamic living system that delivers multiple ecosystem services, such as sustaining water quality and plant productivity, controlling soil nutrient recycling decomposition, and removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Soil health is closely associated with sustainable agriculture, because soil microorganism diversity and activity are the main components of soil health. Agricultural sustainability is defined as the ability of a crop production system to continuously produce food without environmental degradation. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), cyanobacteria, and beneficial nematodes enhance water use efficiency and nutrient availability to plants, phytohormones production, soil nutrient cycling, and plant resistance to environmental stresses. Farming practices have shown that organic farming and tillage improve soil health by increasing the abundance, diversity, and activity of microorganisms. Conservation tillage can potentially increase grower’s profitability by reducing inputs and labor costs as compared to conventional tillage while organic farming might add extra management costs due to high labor demands for weeding and pest control, and for fertilizer inputs (particularly N-based), which typically have less consistent uniformity and stability than synthetic fertilizers. This review will discuss the external factors controlling the abundance of rhizosphere microbiota and the impact of crop management practices on soil health and their role in sustainable crop production.","Food quality and safety are the two important factors that have gained ever-increasing attention in general consumers. Conventionally grown foods have immense adverse health effects due to the presence of higher pesticide residue, more nitrate, heavy metals, hormones, antibiotic residue, and also genetically modified organisms. Moreover, conventionally grown foods are less nutritious and contain lesser amounts of protective antioxidants. In the quest for safer food, the demand for organically grown foods has increased during the last decades due to their probable health benefits and food safety concerns. Organic food production is defined as cultivation without the application of chemical fertilizers and synthetic pesticides or genetically modified organisms, growth hormones, and antibiotics. The popularity of organically grown foods is increasing day by day owing to their nutritional and health benefits. Organic farming also protects the environment and has a greater socio-economic impact on a nation. India is a country that is bestowed with indigenous skills and potentiality for growth in organic agriculture. Although India was far behind in the adoption of organic farming due to several reasons, presently it has achieved rapid growth in organic agriculture and now becomes one of the largest organic producers in the world. Therefore, organic farming has a great impact on the health of a nation like India by ensuring sustainable development.","As a key component of agricultural sustainability, organic fertilizer contributes greatly to improving soil fertility. Therefore, the objective of this review is to revise the role of organic fertilizer on agricultural product and productivity. The newly sourced artificial fertilizer had a short-term benefit, but it had severe long-term side effect such as soil toxicity and decline soil fertility. Afterward, the idea of organic farming was acceptable to developed organic agriculture system. The use of organic fertilizers has advantage of being cheap, improving soil structure, texture and aeration increasing the soils water retention abilities and stimulating healthy root development. Organic fertilizer has many sources such as minerals, animal source, sewage sludge and plant. Vegetables, animals and residue materials had a contribution to improve soil organic matter content in soil. Therefor it is recommended that, using integrated nutrient management is a continuous improvement of soil productivity on longer term basis through appropriate use of organic fertilizers (i.e. animal manure, plants residue and sewage sludge) and their scientific management for increments of optimum growth, yield and quality of different crops.","Promoting sustainability, including the production and consumption of food, is badly needed nowadays, given the fact that consumers are increasingly concerned about protecting their health, through a thorough verification of food quality. From this perspective, organic food may represent a viable solution for a healthier future. Currently, we are witnessing a substantial increase in the number of countries, organizations, and companies encouraging organic farming, an economic activity that involves environmentally friendly agricultural practices. The main objective of this chapter is to reveal the growing importance of organic farming to the food markets. This research will also focus on presenting a very detailed analysis of the defining elements of organic agriculture, such as the evolution of certified organic surfaces, both contributory and disfavoring factors of the developing organic agriculture, and last but not least, overall outlook for global consumption of certified organic products.","The crucial role of healthy soil in achieving sustainable food production and environment is increasingly recognized, as is the importance of proper assessment of soil quality. We introduce a new framework, open soil index (OSI), which integrally evaluates soil health of agricultural fields and provides recommendation for farming practices. The OSI is an open-source modular framework in which soil properties, functions, indicators and scores, and management advice are linked hierarchically. Soil health is evaluated with respect to sustainable crop production but can be extended to other ecosystem functions. The OSI leverages the existing knowledge base of agronomic research and routine laboratory data, enabling its application with limited cost. The OSI is a generic framework that can be adopted for specific regions with specific objectives. As a proof of concept, the OSI is implemented for all (>700,000) Dutch agricultural fields and illustrated with 11 pairs (“good” and “poor”) of local fields and 32 fields where soil quality and crop yield have been monitored. The OSI produced reasonable evaluation for most pairs when soil physical functions were refined with on-site soil visual assessment. The soil functions are sufficiently independent and yet together reflect complex multidimensionality of soil quality. The framework can facilitate designing sustainable soil management programs by bridging regional targets to field-level actions.","Soil is an important natural resource providing water, nutrient, and mechanical support for plant growth. In agroecosystem, continuous manipulation of soil is going on due to addition of input, removal of nutrients, changing water balance, and microbial life. These processes affect soil properties (physical, chemical, and biological), and the deviation of these properties from the normal status is controlled by soil buffering capacity and soil resilience. If these changes are beyond the reach of soil resilience, then soil loses its original state, leading to soil degradation. At present, the extent of the degraded area in the world is 1,036 to 1,470 million ha. This urges the need for maintaining soil health rather than the mere addition of input for crop production. Soil health is an integrative property that reflects the capacity of soil to respond to agricultural intervention, so that it continues to support both agricultural production and the provision of other ecosystem services. Maintaining the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil is needed to keep it healthy, and this is possible through the adoption of different agronomic approaches. The diversification of nutrient sources with emphasis on organic sources, adoption of principles of conservation agriculture, enhancement of soil microbial diversity, efficient resource recycling through the integrated farming system, and amendment addition for correcting soil reactions are potential options for improving soil health, and are discussed in this review. This article reviewed the concept of soil health and its development, issues related to soil health, and indicators of healthy soil. At the same time, the impact of the ill health of the soil on crop productivity and resource use efficiency reported in different parts of the world in recent years are also reviewed. The agro-techniques such as green and brown manuring in arable land and agroforestry on degraded and marginal land were followed on piece meal basis and for economic gain. The potential of these and several other options for maintaining soil need to be recognized, evaluated, and quantified for their wider application on the front of soil health management avenues. The use of crop residue, agro-industrial waste, and untreated mineral or industrial waste (basic slag, phosphogypsum, etc.) as soil amendments has a huge potential in maintaining healthy soil along with serving as sources of crop nutrition. The review emphasizes the evaluation and quantification of present-day followed agro-techniques for their contribution to soil health improvement across agro-climatic regions and for wider implications. Furthermore, emphasis is given to innovative approaches for soil health management rather than mere application of manures and fertilizers for crop nutrition.","Simple Summary Demand for organically grown crops has risen globally due to its healthier and safer food products. From a sustainability perspective, organic farming offers an eco-friendly cultivation system that minimizes agrochemicals and producing food with little or no environmental footprint. However, organic agriculture’s biggest drawback is the generally lower and variable yield in contrast to conventional farming. Compatible with organic farming, the selective use of biostimulants can close the apparent yield gap between organic and conventional cultivation systems. A biostimulant is defined as natural microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) or biologically active substances that are able to improve plant growth and yield through several processes. Biostimulants are derived from a range of natural resources including organic materials (composts, seaweeds), manures (earthworms, fish, insects) and extracts derived from microbes, plant, insect or animal origin. The current trend is indicative that a mixture of biostimulants is generally delivering better growth, yield and quality rather than applying biostimulant individually. When used correctly, biostimulants are known to help plants cope with stressful situations like drought, salinity, extreme temperatures and even certain diseases. More research is needed to understand the different biostimulants, key components, and also to adjust the formulations to improve their reliability in the field. Abstract Demand for organically grown food crops is rising substantially annually owing to their contributions to human health. However, organic farm production is still generally lower compared to conventional farming. Nutrient availability, content consistency, uptake, assimilation, and crop responses to various stresses were reported as critical yield-limiting factors in many organic farming systems. In recent years, plant biostimulants (BSs) have gained much interest from researchers and growers, and with the objective of integrating these products to enhance nutrient use efficiency (NUE), crop performance, and delivering better stress resilience in organic-related farming. This review gave an overview of direct and indirect mechanisms of microbial and non-microbial BSs in enhancing plant nutrient uptake, physiological status, productivity, resilience to various stressors, and soil-microbe-plant interactions. BSs offer a promising, innovative and sustainable strategy to supplement and replace agrochemicals in the near future. With greater mechanistic clarity, designing purposeful combinations of microbial and non-microbial BSs that would interact synergistically and deliver desired outcomes in terms of acceptable yield and high-quality products sustainably will be pivotal. Understanding these mechanisms will improve the next generation of novel and well-characterized BSs, combining microbial and non-microbial BSs strategically with specific desired synergistic bio-stimulatory action, to deliver enhanced plant growth, yield, quality, and resilience consistently in organic-related cultivation.","Agriculture is facing a severe threat to its sustainability due to the growing demands for food, feed, and other renewable nonfood raw materials in the face of global warming. Regenerative agriculture is increasingly recognized as a vital solution to a range of ecological and social issues. It actively revitalizes ecosystems, focusing on soil health, biodiversity, and mitigating climate change, going beyond sustainable practices. Governments and other organizations at all levels, from global to regional, are exploring how regenerative agriculture can be integrated into climate change initiatives to sustain ecosystem. This powerful benefit can be achieved without reducing yields or farmer profits. Soil, as a living and dynamic environment, is home to a diverse range of micro- and macro biota that contribute to its characteristics. Healthy soil is characterized by favorable physical properties (texture, water-holding capacity), chemical properties (pH, soil organic matter; SOM), and biological properties (microbial diversity, and soil respiration), which are essential for nurturing nutritious and profitable crops and improve human health. Regenerative farming is attracting interest from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to improve soil health and sustain ecology. Several academics and non-governmental organizations have attempted to explain the scope and significance of regenerative agriculture. This review outlines how regenerative agriculture practices can mitigate global warming, improve soil health, boost biodiversity, and its socioecological impacts. For future prospects, further scientific research required to examine the effects of regenerative agriculture on both livestock and human health, in order to promote a healthier community.",22.8657651633778,Air Quality and Health Impacts
5,farm; use; animal; production; review; healthy; high; study; effect; potential; growth; fee; research; present; human,"Simple Summary In the process of production, especially the modern intensive scale farming where high quality and high efficiency are pursued, pigs are subjected to a series of adverse stimuli from birth to slaughter (e.g., immunotherapy, environmental changes, uncomfortable temperature, feed contamination, improper transportation, slaughter methods, etc.). These adverse stimuli eventually translate into an imbalance in redox levels in the body, resulting in oxidative stress. The generation of oxidative stress, in turn, eventually causes damage to the pigs. To eliminate/reduce this harmful effect and counteract oxidative stress, pigs use part of the energy reserved for growth, which eventually leads to a decrease in production performance and causes unnecessary economic losses. Abstract Oxidative stress refers to the dramatic increase in the production of free radicals in human and animal bodies or the decrease in the ability to scavenging free radicals, thus breaking the antioxidation–oxidation balance. Various factors can induce oxidative stress in pig production. Oxidative stress has an important effect on pig performance and healthy growth, and has become one of the important factors restricting pig production. Based on the overview of the generation of oxidative stress, its effects on pigs, and signal transduction pathways, this paper discussed the nutritional measures to alleviate oxidative stress in pigs, in order to provide ideas for the nutritional research of anti-oxidative stress in pigs.","Simple Summary The search for alternative and sustainable protein sources in poultry production is an issue of major importance due to the increasing demand of products of animal origin and, consequently, of feedstuffs to feed food-producing animals. The latter is exacerbating the overexploitation of natural resources, thus increasing the environmental impact of animal farming, as well as the prices of raw materials. In this sense, insects have been indicated as one of the possible alternatives to solve this problem, thus research efforts to test the feasibility of a practical application to the poultry sector are required. Therefore, the present study tested different inclusion levels of a defatted black soldier fly larvae protein meal in the diets for laying quails as an alternative ingredient to the soybean meal and oil. Results of the present study showed that the insect meal can technically be applied to laying quails’ feed formulations, providing optimal performance and health status. Egg nutritional quality and sensory profile too did not worsen when quails were fed with the insect meal supplementation. Further research efforts should be performed to improve the healthiness of the lipid fraction of the tested insect larvae and, in turn, the lipid quality of the eggs obtained from insect-fed quails. Abstract Insects are promising candidates as alternative sustainable sources of protein for poultry species. The present research studied the effect of a dietary inclusion of a defatted black soldier fly (BSF) larvae meal as an alternative protein source in the diets of laying quails, on productive performance, egg physicochemical quality, fatty acid profile, sensory traits and storage stability. A total of 225 laying quails were divided into 3 dietary groups (5 replicates/each). A conventional soybean meal-based diet was formulated (Control group), and two other diets were formulated including either 10% (BSF10) or 15% (BSF15) defatted BSF larvae meal. Laying quails showed satisfactory productive performance throughout the trial. BSF10 and BSF15 eggs had the highest shape index (p < 0.01), shell weight and percentage (p < 0.001) and the most intense yolk color (p < 0.001). Defatted BSF larvae meal increased the eggs’ saturated fatty acid content (p < 0.001) to the detriment of the polyunsaturated fraction (p < 0.001). Overall the eggs’ sensory profile was not affected by the dietary treatment, but BSF15 eggs had a higher feed off-flavor vs Control group (p < 0.05). At day 28 of storage, oxidative stability was higher in BSF10 vs. Control eggs (p < 0.01). Defatted BSF larvae meal can be considered a possible alternative ingredient to soybean meal in laying quail diets, up to the 15% inclusion level.","Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) often referred to as phytobiotics or botanical feed additives, are natural compounds derived from various plants, herbs, spices and other botanical sources. These feed additives are intended to serve a variety of purposes, including an immune system regulator, an antimicrobial, an antimutagenic, an antioxidant and a growth promoter. They are composed of bioactive compounds extracted from plants, including essential oils, polyphenols, terpenoids and flavonoids. They are mostly utilized as substitute antibiotic growth promoters in nonruminant (swine and poultry) livestock production, owing to the prohibition of antibiotic usage in the feed industry. It has been thoroughly examined to ascertain their impact on intestinal health and activity, correlation with animals' effective health and well-being, productivity, food security and environmental impact. The potential uses of these feed additives depend on the properties of herbs, the comprehension of their principal and secondary components, knowledge of their mechanisms of action, the safety of animals and the products they produce. They are gaining recognition as effective and sustainable tools for promoting animal health and performance while reducing the reliance on antibiotics in nonruminant nutrition. Their natural origins, multifaceted benefits and alignment with consumer preferences make them a valuable addition to modern animal farming process. However, because of their inconsistent effects and inadequate knowledge of the mechanisms of action, their usage as a feed additive has been limited. This review offers a comprehensive assessment of the applications of PFAs as an effective feed supplement in swine and poultry nutrition. In summary, this comprehensive review provides current knowledge, identifies gaps in research and emphasizes the potential of phytogenic additives to foster sustainable and healthier livestock production systems while addressing the global concerns associated with antibiotic use in livestock farming.","The high use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases is one of the main problems in the mass production of animal protein. Salmon farming in Chile is a clear example of the above statement, where more than 5,500 tonnes of antibiotics have been used over the last 10 years. This has caused a great impact both at the production level and on the environment; however, there are still few works in relation to it. In order to demonstrate the impact of the high use of antibiotics on fish gut microbiota, we have selected four salmon farms presenting a similar amount of fish of the Atlantic salmon species (Salmo salar), ranging from 4,500 to 6,000 tonnes. All of these farms used treatments with high doses of antibiotics. Thus, 15 healthy fish were selected and euthanised in order to isolate the bacteria resistant to the antibiotics oxytetracycline and florfenicol from the gut microbiota. In total, 47 bacterial isolates resistant to florfenicol and 44 resistant to oxytetracycline were isolated, among which isolates with Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) exceeding 2048 μg/mL for florfenicol and 1024 μg/mL for oxytetracycline were found. In addition, another six different antibiotics were tested in order to demonstrate the multiresistance phenomenon. In this regard, six isolates of 91 showed elevated resistance values for the eight tested antibiotics, including florfenicol and oxytetracycline, were found. These bacteria were called “super-resistant” bacteria. This phenotypic resistance was verified at a genotypic level since most isolates showed antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to florfenicol and oxytetracycline. Specifically, 77% of antibiotic resistant bacteria showed at least one gene resistant to florfenicol and 89% showed at least one gene resistant to oxytetracycline. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the high use of the antibiotics florfenicol and oxytetracycline has, as a consequence, the selection of multiresistant bacteria in the gut microbiota of farmed fish of the Salmo salar species at the seawater stage. Also, the phenotypic resistance of these bacteria can be correlated with the presence of antibiotic resistance genes.","The human population is growing, and as a result we need to produce more food whilst reducing the impact of farming on the environment. Selective breeding and genomic selection have had a transformational impact on livestock productivity, and now transgenic and genome-editing technologies offer exciting opportunities for the production of fitter, healthier and more-productive livestock. Here, we review recent progress in the application of genome editing to farmed animal species and discuss the potential impact on our ability to produce food.","Sustainable production of healthy food for a growing global population, in the face of the uncertainties of climate change, represents a major challenge for the coming decade. Livestock provide food with high nutritional value but are frequently fed on human-edible crops and are associated with significant production of greenhouse gases. Recent years have seen increasing interest in the farming of insects as a sustainable source of human food, or as a replacement of ingredients such as soya or fishmeal in the feeds of terrestrial livestock or fish. This review provides an overview of insect physiology and growth regulation, considers the requirements for insect farming and mass production, and summarizes the nutritional value of the 10 most commonly studied insect species, before reviewing the literature on the use of insects as feed and food. We highlight the challenges required to develop a sustainable, safe, and affordable insect farming industry.

Recent studies have elucidated substantial divergences in the microbiome structure between healthy individuals from different race and ethnicity. This review provides a comprehensive account of such geography, ethnicity or life-style-specific variations in healthy microbiome at five major body habitats—Gut, Oral-cavity, Respiratory Tract, Skin, and Urogenital Tract (UGT). The review focuses on the general trend in the human microbiome evolution—a gradual transition in the gross compositional structure along with a continual decrease in diversity of the microbiome, especially of the gut microbiome, as the human populations passed through three stages of subsistence like foraging, rural farming and industrialized urban western life. In general, gut microbiome of the hunter-gatherer populations is highly abundant with Prevotella, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Clostridiales, Ruminobacter etc., while those of the urban communities are often enriched in Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Firmicutes. The oral and skin microbiome are the next most diverse among different populations, while respiratory tract and UGT microbiome show lesser variations. Higher microbiome diversity is observed for oral-cavity in hunter-gatherer group with higher prevalence of Haemophilus than agricultural group. In case of skin microbiome, rural and urban Chinese populations show variation in abundance of Trabulsiella and Propionibacterium. On the basis of published data, we have characterized the core microbiota—the set of genera commonly found in all populations, irrespective of their geographic locations, ethnicity or mode of subsistence. We have also identified the major factors responsible for geography-based alterations in microbiota; though it is not yet clear which factor plays a dominant role in shaping the microbiome—nature or nurture, host genetics or his environment. Some of the geographical/racial variations in microbiome structure have been attributed to differences in host genetics and innate/adaptive immunity, while in many other cases, cultural/behavioral features like diet, hygiene, parasitic load, environmental exposure etc. overshadow genetics. The ethnicity or population-specific variations in human microbiome composition, as reviewed in this report, question the universality of the microbiome-based therapeutic strategies and recommend for geographically tailored community-scale approaches to microbiome engineering.","Although the production of safe food for human consumption is the primary purpose for animal rearing, the environment and well-being of the animals must also be taken into consideration. Based on microbiological point of view, the production of healthy food from animals involves considering foodborne pathogens, on the one hand and on the other hand, the methods used to fight against germs during breeding. The conventional method to control or prevent bacterial infections in farming is the use antibiotics. However, the banning of these compounds as growth promoters caused many changes in animal breeding and their use has since been limited to the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. In this function, their importance no longer needs to be demonstrated, but unfortunately, their excessive and abusive use have led to a double problem which can have harmful consequences on consumer health: Resistance to antibiotics and the presence of antibiotic residues in food. The use of probiotics appears to be a suitable alternative to overcome these problems because of their ability to modulate the immune system and intestinal microflora, and further considering their antagonistic role against certain pathogenic bacteria and their ability to play the role of growth factor (sometimes associated with prebiotics) when used as feed additives. This review aims to highlight some of the negative effects of the use of antibiotics in animal rearing as well as emphasize the current knowledge on the use of probiotics as a feed additive, their influence on animal production and their potential utility as an alternative to conventional antibiotics, particularly in poultry, pig, and fish farming.","Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is an important shrimp bacterial disease caused by some Vibrio species. The severity of the impact of this disease on aquaculture worldwide has made it necessary to develop alternatives to prophylactic antibiotics use, such as the application of probiotics. To assess the potential to use probiotics in order to limit the detrimental effects of AHNPD, we evaluated the effect of the ILI strain, a Vibrio sp. bacterium and efficient shrimp probiotic, using metabarcoding (16S rRNA gene) on the gastrointestinal microbiota of shrimp after being challenged with AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus. We showed how the gastrointestinal microbiome of shrimp varied between healthy and infected organisms. Nevertheless, a challenge of working with AHPND-causing Vibrio pathogens and Vibrio-related bacteria as probiotics is the potential risk of the probiotic strain becoming pathogenic. Consequently, we evaluated whether ILI strain can acquire the plasmid pV-AHPND via horizontal transfer and further cause the disease in shrimp. Conjugation assays were performed resulting in a high frequency (70%) of colonies harboring the pv-AHPND. However, no shrimp mortality was observed when transconjugant colonies of the ILI strain were used in a challenge test using healthy shrimp. We sequenced the genome of the ILI strain and performed comparative genomics analyses using AHPND and non-AHPND Vibrio isolates. Using available phylogenetic and phylogenomics analyses, we reclassified the ILI strain as Vibrio diabolicus. In summary, this work represents an effort to study the role that probiotics play in the normal gastrointestinal shrimp microbiome and in AHPND-infected shrimp, showing that the ILI probiotic was able to control pathogenic bacterial populations in the host's gastrointestinal tract and stimulate the shrimp’s survival. The identification of probiotic bacterial species that are effective in the host’s colonization is important to promote animal health and prevent disease. This study describes probiotic bacteria capable of controlling pathogenic populations of bacteria in the shrimp gastrointestinal tract. Our work provides new insights into the complex dynamics between shrimp and the changes in the microbiota. It also addresses the practical application of probiotics to solve problems with pathogens that cause high mortality-rate in shrimp farming around the world. 5HokUSghi4XQ9JWVrk_iSc Video Abstract Video Abstract","Goat meat could be a sustainable source of red meat. Its farming requires minimal input, is suitable for free-range farming, and produces a healthier red meat option as it is lean. Although goat meat has advantages for meat production, it still needs to be established as a valuable part of the meat trade market. But, currently, goat meat production is less specialized; there is less intense breed selection for premium meat production, and often the animals are farmed with a multifunctional purpose, such as for their meat, fiber, and milk. The less structured goat meat industry contributes to the inconsistent quality of goat meat. This paper attempts to describe the characteristics of popular goat breeds and indigenous goats as a source of meat and the potential of various goat breeds for meat production. Additionally, this paper presents goat meat’s quality and physicochemical and sensory attributes that are relevant to understanding the unique attributes of goat meat. Much work is needed for the goat meat processing industry to develop its potential.",32.1598437042972,Neurodegenerative Disease Research
