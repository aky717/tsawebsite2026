This is clearly unsustainable, and the amount of land we protect for nature needs to be increased and preserved. However, this still leaves vast regions of the world unprotected and modified. Such landscapes do not have to be a lost cause. Kremen and Merenlender review how biodiversity-based techniques can be used to manage most human-modified lands as “working landscapes.” These can provide for human needs and maintain biodiversity not just for ecosystem services but also for maintenance and persistence of nonhuman species. Science, this issue p. eaau6020 BACKGROUND Biodiversity is under siege, with greatly enhanced rates of local and global extinction and the decline of once-abundant species. Current rates of human-induced climate change and land use forecast the Anthropocene as one of the most devastating epochs for life on earth. How do we handle the Anthropocene’s triple challenge of preventing biodiversity loss, mitigating and adapting to climate change, and sustainably providing resources for a growing human population? The answer is in how we manage Earth’s “working lands”; that is, farms, forests, and rangelands. These lands must be managed both to complement the biodiversity conservation goals of protected areas and to maintain the diverse communities of organisms, from microbes to mammals, that contribute to producing food, materials, clean water, and healthy soils; sequestering greenhouse gases; and buffering extreme weather events, functions that are essential for all life on Earth. ADVANCES Protected areas are the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation. Although the total area of protected regions needs to be increased, parks will nonetheless continue to lose species if these areas are isolated from one another by inhospitable land uses and are faced with a rapidly changing climate. Further, many species, such as those that migrate, remain unprotected as they occupy lands outside of parks for all or portions of their life cycles. Lastly, protected-area effectiveness is greatly influenced by surrounding land management. “Working lands conservation” aims to support biodiversity while providing goods and services for humanity over the long term, assuring sustainability and resilience. By managing lands surrounding parks favorably, working lands can buffer protected areas from threats and connect them to one another. This approach complements protected areas by providing accessory habitats and resources for some species while facilitating dispersal and climate change adaptation for others. Further, by maintaining the biodiversity that supplies critical ecosystem services within working lands, these approaches ensure that the production of food, fiber, fuel, and timber can be sustained over the long run and be more resilient to extreme events, such as floods, droughts, hurricanes, and pest and disease outbreaks, which are becoming more frequent with climate change. A variety of biodiversity-based land management techniques can be used in working lands, including agroforestry, silvopasture, diversified farming, and ecosystem-based forest management, to ensure sustainable production of food and fiber. OUTLOOK The underlying principle of biodiversity-based management of working lands has been practiced since ancient times. Today, these systems have largely been replaced by unsustainable resource extraction, rather than serving as models that could be adapted to modern conditions. Although various regulatory, voluntary, and financial tools exist to promote sustainable land management, many barriers prevent individuals, communities, and corporations from adopting biodiversity-based practices, including deeply entrenched policy and market conditions that favor industrialized or extractive models of land use. Thus, uptake of these approaches has been patchy and slow and is not yet sufficient to create change at the temporal and spatial scales needed to face the triple Anthropocene threat. Biodiversity-based land management practices are knowledge- rather than technology-intensive. They are well adapted to empower local communities to manage their natural resources. One of the most exciting emerging trends is community-driven initiatives to manage working landscapes for conservation and sustainability. By linking up through grassroots organizations, social movements, and public-private partnerships, these initiatives can scale up to create collective impact and can demand changes in government policies to facilitate the conservation of working lands. Scientists and conservation practitioners can support these initiatives by engaging with the public, listening to alternative ways of knowing, and cocreating landscapes that work for biodiversity and people.

KREMEN How can we manage farmlands, forests, and rangelands to respond to the triple challenge of the Anthropocene—biodiversity loss, climate change, and unsustainable land use? When managed by using biodiversity-based techniques such as agroforestry, silvopasture, diversified farming, and ecosystem-based forest management, these socioeconomic systems can help maintain biodiversity and provide habitat connectivity, thereby complementing protected areas and providing greater resilience to climate change. Simultaneously, the use of these management techniques can improve yields and profitability more sustainably, enhancing livelihoods and food security. This approach to “working lands conservation” can create landscapes that work for nature and people. However, many socioeconomic challenges impede the uptake of biodiversity-based land management practices. Although improving voluntary incentives, market instruments, environmental regulations, and governance is essential to support working lands conservation, it is community action, social movements, and broad coalitions among citizens, businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies that have the power to transform how we manage land and protect the environment.",http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6412/eaau6020.full.pdf,

Today it is applied on more than 30 million ha worldwide. Europe is the largest commercial market for invertebrate biological control agents, while North America has the largest sales of microbials. A strong growth in use of ABC, particularly of microbial agents, is taking place in Latin America, followed by Asia. The current popularity of ABC is due to (1) its inherent positive characteristics (healthier for farm workers and persons living in farming communities, no harvesting interval or waiting period after release of agents, sustainable as there is no development of resistance against arthropod natural enemies, no phytotoxic damage to plants, better yields and a healthier product, reduced pesticide residues [well below the legal Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs)], (2) professionalism of the biological control industry (inexpensive large scale mass production, proper quality control, efficient packaging, distribution and release methods, and availability of many (>440 species) control agents for numerous pests), (3) a number of recent successes showing how biological control can save agricultural production when pesticides fail or are not available, (4) several non-governmental organizations (NGOs), consumers, and retailers demanding pesticide residues far below the legal MRLs, and (5) policy developments in several regions of the world aimed at reduction and replacement of synthetic pesticides by more sustainable methods of pest management. We are convinced, however, that ABC can be applied on a much larger area than it is today. We plead in the short term for a pragmatic form of agriculture that is adaptable, non-dogmatic and combines the sustainability gain from all types of agriculture and pest management methods. We then propose to move to “conscious agriculture”, which involves participation of all stakeholders in the production and consumer chain, and respects the environment and resource availability for future generations. Were “conscious agriculture” to be considered a serious alternative to conventional farming, ABC would face an even brighter future.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10526-017-9801-4.pdf,

Recent studies have elucidated substantial divergences in the microbiome structure between healthy individuals from different race and ethnicity. This review provides a comprehensive account of such geography, ethnicity or life-style-specific variations in healthy microbiome at five major body habitats—Gut, Oral-cavity, Respiratory Tract, Skin, and Urogenital Tract (UGT). The review focuses on the general trend in the human microbiome evolution—a gradual transition in the gross compositional structure along with a continual decrease in diversity of the microbiome, especially of the gut microbiome, as the human populations passed through three stages of subsistence like foraging, rural farming and industrialized urban western life. In general, gut microbiome of the hunter-gatherer populations is highly abundant with Prevotella, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Clostridiales, Ruminobacter etc., while those of the urban communities are often enriched in Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Firmicutes. The oral and skin microbiome are the next most diverse among different populations, while respiratory tract and UGT microbiome show lesser variations. Higher microbiome diversity is observed for oral-cavity in hunter-gatherer group with higher prevalence of Haemophilus than agricultural group. In case of skin microbiome, rural and urban Chinese populations show variation in abundance of Trabulsiella and Propionibacterium. On the basis of published data, we have characterized the core microbiota—the set of genera commonly found in all populations, irrespective of their geographic locations, ethnicity or mode of subsistence. We have also identified the major factors responsible for geography-based alterations in microbiota; though it is not yet clear which factor plays a dominant role in shaping the microbiome—nature or nurture, host genetics or his environment. Some of the geographical/racial variations in microbiome structure have been attributed to differences in host genetics and innate/adaptive immunity, while in many other cases, cultural/behavioral features like diet, hygiene, parasitic load, environmental exposure etc. overshadow genetics. The ethnicity or population-specific variations in human microbiome composition, as reviewed in this report, question the universality of the microbiome-based therapeutic strategies and recommend for geographically tailored community-scale approaches to microbiome engineering.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01162/pdf,

We first identify drivers transforming food systems. We then apply these to the cereal value chains and disentangle their effects on food security. We thereby add to the three strands in the literature around production, consumption, and food system transformation and point to different research needs and recommendations for the future. The review highlights: (1) Wheat and maize production will be increasingly impaired by ecological drivers such as land degradation, water scarcity and climate change. (2) There are promising innovations to increase and maintain productivity, but constraints in adopting these innovations have to be overcome (i.e., access to seeds, finance, and education/training).

Farming practices have shown that organic farming and tillage improve soil health by increasing the abundance, diversity, and activity of microorganisms. Conservation tillage can potentially increase grower’s profitability by reducing inputs and labor costs as compared to conventional tillage while organic farming might add extra management costs due to high labor demands for weeding and pest control, and for fertilizer inputs (particularly N-based), which typically have less consistent uniformity and stability than synthetic fertilizers.

Consumers perceive the need to increase the level of welfare in farm animals, despite the fact that their level of knowledge about farming and animal welfare issues is relatively low. Consumers concerns are not equally distributed among the different farm species, nor is there consistency in the willingness to pay to enhance animal welfare. Therefore, farmers, businesses, and members of the food chain need to be informed of the evolution of public perceptions and consumer concerns to make informed decisions that help them improve their sustainability, social responsibility, and public credibility, which will allow them to maintain their social license through social ethical approval. Abstract In this paper, we explore the evolution of consumers’ perceptions and concerns about the effects that intensification of production systems could have on the welfare of farm animals. Despite the differences in definitions of animal welfare that make perceptions about this complex subject extremely variable, there is a growing perception that farm animal welfare should be protected and improved. There is an increasing appreciation of animal welfare parameters over other quality attributes, and animal-friendly products are considered healthier, safer, tastier, more hygienic, authentic, environmentally friendly, and traditional by many consumers. The willingness to pay for the increases in price that higher levels of farm animal welfare could produce could be promoted by means of adequate information about management and housing conditions of the different farming species. Welfare-friendly products that are properly labeled with clear information provided by an internationally accepted, transparent, and traceable monitoring system will increase consumers’ confidence in the food chain participants. Both consumers and citizens have the opportunity to improve the welfare of millions of farmed animals now and in the future, consumers by assuming their responsibility at the buying point, purchasing welfare-friendly products, and citizens by driving legislation to achieve some minimum standard of welfare conditions that could meet animals’ needs.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/3/385/pdf,

The development of asthma is influenced by environmental and other exogenous factors synergizing with genetic predisposition, and shaping the lung microbiome especially during birth and in very early life. The healthy lung microbial composition is characterized by a prevalence of bacteria belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. However, viral respiratory infections are associated with an abundance of Proteobacteria with genera Haemophilus and Moraxella in young children and adult asthmatics. This dysbiosis supports the activation of inflammatory pathways and contributes to bronchoconstriction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Exogenous factors can affect the natural lung microbiota composition positively (farming environment) or negatively (allergens, air pollutants). It is evident that also gut microbiota dysbiosis has a high influence on asthma pathogenesis. Antibiotics, antiulcer medications, and other drugs severely impair gut as well as lung microbiota. Resulting dysbiosis and reduced microbial diversity dysregulate the bidirectional crosstalk across the gut-lung axis, resulting in hypersensitivity and hyperreactivity to respiratory and food allergens.

Multidisciplinary studies have established molecular, cellular, organ and somatic functions of the CK/PCr system, in particular for cells and tissues with high and intermittent energy fluctuations. These studies include tissue-specific expression and subcellular localization of CK isoforms, high-resolution molecular structures and structure–function relationships, transgenic CK abrogation and reverse genetic approaches. Three energy-related physiological principles emerge, namely that the CK/PCr systems functions as (a) an immediately available temporal energy buffer, (b) a spatial energy buffer or intracellular energy transport system (the CK/PCr energy shuttle or circuit) and (c) a metabolic regulator. The CK/PCr energy shuttle connects sites of ATP production (glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation) with subcellular sites of ATP utilization (ATPases). Thus, diffusion limitations of ADP and ATP are overcome by PCr/Cr shuttling, as most clearly seen in polar cells such as spermatozoa, retina photoreceptor cells and sensory hair bundles of the inner ear. The CK/PCr system relies on the close exchange of substrates and products between CK isoforms and ATP-generating or -consuming processes. Mitochondrial CK in the mitochondrial outer compartment, for example, is tightly coupled to ATP export via adenine nucleotide transporter or carrier (ANT) and thus ATP-synthesis and respiratory chain activity, releasing PCr into the cytosol. This coupling also reduces formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibits mitochondrial permeability transition, an early event in apoptosis. Cr itself may also act as a direct and/or indirect anti-oxidant, while PCr can interact with and protect cellular membranes. Collectively, these factors may well explain the beneficial effects of Cr supplementation. The stimulating effects of Cr for muscle and bone growth and maintenance, and especially in neuroprotection, are now recognized and the first clinical studies are underway. Novel socio-economically relevant applications of Cr supplementation are emerging, e.g. for senior people, intensive care units and dialysis patients, who are notoriously Cr-depleted. Also, Cr will likely be beneficial for the healthy development of premature infants, who after separation from the placenta depend on external Cr. Cr supplementation of pregnant and lactating women, as well as of babies and infants are likely to be of benefit for child development. Last but not least, Cr harbours a global ecological potential as an additive for animal feed, replacing meat- and fish meal for animal (poultry and swine) and fish aqua farming. This may help to alleviate human starvation and at the same time prevent over-fishing of oceans.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00726-011-0877-3.pdf,

The production of crops affects the economy of a country to a great extent. In agriculture, observing the soil, weather, and water availability and, based on these factors, selecting an appropriate crop, finding the availability of seeds, analysing crop demand in the market, and having knowledge of crop cultivation are important. At present, many advancements have been made in recent times, starting from crop selection to crop cutting. Mainly, the roles of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and machine learning tools help a farmer to analyse and make better decisions in each stage of cultivation. Once suitable crop seeds are chosen, the farmer shall proceed with seeding, monitoring crop growth, disease detection, finding the ripening stage of the crop, and then crop cutting. The main objective is to provide a continuous support system to a farmer so that he can obtain regular inputs about his field and crop. Additionally, he should be able to make proper decisions at each stage of farming. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, the cloud, sensors, and other automated devices shall be included in the decision support system so that it will provide the right information within a short time span. By using the support system, a farmer will be able to take decisive measures without fully depending on the local agriculture offices. We have proposed an IoT-enabled soil nutrient classification and crop recommendation (IoTSNA-CR) model to recommend crops. The model helps to minimise the use of fertilisers in soil so as to maximise productivity. The proposed model consists of phases, such as data collection using IoT sensors from cultivation lands, storing this real-time data into cloud memory services, accessing this cloud data using an Android application, and then pre-processing and periodic analysis of it using different learning techniques. A sensory system was prepared with optimised cost that contains different sensors, such as a soil temperature sensor, a soil moisture sensor, a water level indicator, a pH sensor, a GPS sensor, and a colour sensor, along with an Arduino UNO board. This sensory system allowed us to collect moisture, temperature, water level, soil NPK colour values, date, time, longitude, and latitude. The studies have revealed that the Agrinex NPK soil testing tablets should be applied to a soil sample, and then the soil colour can be sensed using an LDR colour sensor to predict the phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and potassium (K) values. These collected data together were stored in Firebase cloud storage media. Then, an Android application was developed to fetch and analyse the data from the Firebase cloud service from time to time by a farmer. In this study, a novel approach was identified via the hybridisation of algorithms. We have developed an algorithm using a multi-class support vector machine with a directed acyclic graph and optimised it using the fruit fly optimisation method (MSVM-DAG-FFO). The highest accuracy rate of this algorithm is 0.973, compared to 0.932 for SVM, 0.922 for SVM kernel, and 0.914 for decision tree. It has been observed that the overall performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-Score is high compared to other methods. The IoTSNA-CR device allows the farmer to maintain his field soil information easily in the cloud service using his own mobile with minimum knowledge. Additionally, it reduces the expenditure to balance the soil minerals and increases productivity.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/12/3/61/pdf?version=1679051021,

To overcome the increasing market demand, the transition to the intensification of shrimp farming is a reality in many countries. In addition, the desire to mitigate the risks posed by pathogens has driven many farmers to preference more controlled intensive systems with higher biosecurity. Shrimp nutrition and breeding are other areas that have directly enabled and improved intensification and will continue to be critical to ongoing growth in this sector. From this perspective, the aim of this review is to provide an update of the current production systems and strategies and explore the advances and key contributions that nutrition, breeding, and pathogen surveillance are having towards intensification and super-intensive shrimp culture. Abstract Intensification of the shrimp sector, also referred to as vertical expansion, has been predominately driven by consecutive incidences of global disease outbreaks, which have caused enormous economic loss for the main producer countries. A growing segment of the shrimp farming industry has opted to use production systems with higher density, biosecurity, and operating control to mitigate the risks posed by disease. However, successful super-intensive shrimp production is reliant on an advanced understanding of many important biological and economic parameters in the farming system, coupled with effective monitoring, to maintain optimal production. Compared to traditional extensive or semi-intensive systems, super-intensive systems require higher inputs of feed, energy, labor, and supplements. These systems are highly sensitive to the interactions between these different inputs and require that the biological and economical parameters of farming are carefully balanced to ensure success. Advancing nutritional knowledge and tools to support consistent and efficient production of shrimp in these high-cost super-intensive systems is also necessary. Breeding programs developing breeding-lines selected for these challenging super-intensive environments are critical. Understanding synergies between the key areas of production systems, nutrition, and breeding are crucial for super-intensive farming as all three areas coalesce to influence the health of shrimp and commercial farming success. This article reviews current strategies and innovations being used for Litopenaeus vannamei in production systems, nutrition, and breeding, and discusses the synergies across these areas that can support the production of healthy and high-quality shrimp in super-intensive systems. Finally, we briefly discuss some key issues of social license pertinent to the super-intensive shrimp farming industry.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/3/236/pdf?version=1642670079,

The concept of ecosystem services is widely used in decision making in the context of valuing the service potentials, benefits, and use values that well-functioning ecosystems provide to humans and the biosphere and, as an endpoint (value to be protected), in ecological risk assessment of chemicals. Neonicotinoid insecticides are frequently detected in soil and water and are also found in air, as dust particles during sowing of crops and aerosols during spraying. These environmental media provide essential resources to support biodiversity, but are known to be threatened by long-term or repeated contamination by neonicotinoids and fipronil. We review the state of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of these insecticides on ecosystem functioning and services provided by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including soil and freshwater functions, fisheries, biological pest control, and pollination services. Empirical studies examining the specific impacts of neonicotinoids and fipronil to ecosystem services have focused largely on the negative impacts to beneficial insect species (honeybees) and the impact on pollination service of food crops. However, here we document broader evidence of the effects on ecosystem functions regulating soil and water quality, pest control, pollination, ecosystem resilience, and community diversity. In particular, microbes, invertebrates, and fish play critical roles as decomposers, pollinators, consumers, and predators, which collectively maintain healthy communities and ecosystem integrity. Several examples in this review demonstrate evidence of the negative impacts of systemic insecticides on decomposition, nutrient cycling, soil respiration, and invertebrate populations valued by humans. Invertebrates, particularly earthworms that are important for soil processes, wild and domestic insect pollinators which are important for plant and crop production, and several freshwater taxa which are involved in aquatic nutrient cycling, were all found to be highly susceptible to lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and/or fipronil at environmentally relevant concentrations. By contrast, most microbes and fish do not appear to be as sensitive under normal exposure scenarios, though the effects on fish may be important in certain realms such as combined fish-rice farming systems and through food chain effects. We highlight the economic and cultural concerns around agriculture and aquaculture production and the role these insecticides may have in threatening food security. Overall, we recommend improved sustainable agricultural practices that restrict systemic insecticide use to maintain and support several ecosystem services that humans fundamentally depend on.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-014-3277-x.pdf,

Timsina,Can Organic Sources of Nutrients Increase Crop Yields to Meet Global Food Demand?,2018,Agronomy,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b806dc26be64aa3fb09551e218f272ecbc2d481,,27,2026-01-21 22:25:54,Review,10.3390/AGRONOMY8100214,2073-4395,,,,,,269,33.63,269,1,8,"Meeting global demand of safe and healthy food for the ever-increasing population now and into the future is currently a crucial challenge. Increasing crop production by preserving environment and mitigating climate change should thus be the main goal of today’s agriculture. Conventional farming is characterized by use of high-yielding varieties, irrigation water, chemical fertilizers and synthetic pesticides to increase yields. However, due to either over- or misuse of chemical fertilizers or pesticides in many agro-ecosystems, such farming is often blamed for land degradation and environmental pollution and for adversely affecting the health of humans, plants, animals and aquatic ecosystems. Of all inputs required for increased agricultural production, nutrients are considered to be the most important ones. Organic farming, with use of organic sources of nutrients, is proposed as a sustainable strategy for producing safe, healthy and cheaper food and for restoring soil fertility and mitigating climate change. However, there are several myths and controversies surrounding the use of organic versus inorganic sources of nutrients. The objectives of this paper are: (i) to clarify some of the myths or misconceptions about organic versus inorganic sources of nutrients and (ii) to propose alternative solutions to increase on-farm biomass production for use as organic inputs for improving soil fertility and increasing crop yields. Common myths identified by this review include that organic materials/fertilizers can: (i) supply all required macro- and micro-nutrients for plants; (ii) improve physical, chemical and microbiological properties of soils; (iii) be applied universally on all soils; (iv) always produce quality products; (v) be cheaper and affordable; and (vi) build-up of large amount of soil organic matter. Other related myths are: “legumes can use entire amount of N2 fixed from atmosphere” and “bio-fertilizers increase nutrient content of soil.” Common myths regarding chemical fertilizers are that they: (i) are not easily available and affordable, (ii) degrade land, (iii) pollute environment and (iv) adversely affect health of humans, animals and agro-ecosystems. The review reveals that, except in some cases where higher yields (and higher profits) can be found from organic farming, their yields are generally 20–50% lower than that from conventional farming. The paper demonstrates that considering the current organic sources of nutrients in the developing countries, organic nutrients alone are not enough to increase crop yields to meet global food demand and that nutrients from inorganic and organic sources should preferably be applied at 75:25 ratio. The review identifies a new and alternative concept of Evergreen Agriculture (an extension of Agroforestry System), which has potential to supply organic nutrients in much higher amounts, improve on-farm soil fertility and meet nutrient demand of high-yielding crops, sequester carbon and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, provide fodder for livestock and fuelwood for farmers and has potential to meet global food demand. Evergreen Agriculture has been widely adapted by tens of millions of farmers in several African countries and the review proposes for evaluation and scaling-up of such technology in Asian and Latin American countries too.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/8/10/214/pdf?version=1538580409,

Competition for land, in itself, is not a driver affecting food and farming in the future, but is an emergent property of other drivers and pressures. Modelling studies suggest that future policy decisions in the agriculture, forestry, energy and conservation sectors could have profound effects, with different demands for land to supply multiple ecosystem services usually intensifying competition for land in the future. In addition to policies addressing agriculture and food production, further policies addressing the primary drivers of competition for land (population growth, dietary preference, protected areas, forest policy) could have significant impacts in reducing competition for land. Technologies for increasing per-area productivity of agricultural land will also be necessary. Key uncertainties in our projections of competition for land in the future relate predominantly to uncertainties in the drivers and pressures within the scenarios, in the models and data used in the projections and in the policy interventions assumed to affect the drivers and pressures in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2010.0127,

Farmers can make the most of the resources at their disposal thanks to this data-driven approach, allowing them to effectively cultivate and sustain crops on arable land. The European Union (EU) aims to make food systems fair, healthy, and environmentally sustainable through the Green Deal and its farm-to-fork, soil, and biodiversity strategies, zero pollution action plan, and upcoming sustainable use of pesticides regulation. Many of the historical synthetic pesticides are not currently registered in the EU market. In addition, the continuous use of a limited number of active ingredients with the same mode of action scales up pests/pathogens/weed resistance potential. Increasing plant protection challenges as well as having fewer chemical pesticides to apply require innovation and smart solutions for crop production.

Paradoxically, conventional farming practices are undermining these services and resulting in degraded soils, polluted waters, greenhouse gas emissions and massive loss of biodiversity including declines in pollinators. In essence, farming is undermining the ecosystem services it relies upon. Finding alternative more sustainable ways to meet growing food demands which simultaneously support biodiversity is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. Here, we review the potential of urban and peri-urban agriculture to contribute to sustainable food production, using the 17 sustainable development goals set by the United Nations General Assembly as a framework. We present new data from a case study of urban gardens and allotments in the city of Brighton and Hove, UK. Such urban and peri-urban landholdings tend to be small and labour-intensive, characterised by a high diversity of crops including perennials and annuals. Our data demonstrate that this type of agricultural system can be highly productive and that it has environmental and social advantages over industrial agriculture in that crops are usually produced using few synthetic inputs and are destined for local consumption. Overall, we conclude that food grown on small-scale areas in and near cities is making a significant contribution to feeding the world and that this type of agriculture is likely to be relatively favourable for some ecosystem services, such as supporting healthy soils. However, major knowledge gaps remain, for example with regard to productivity, economic and employment impacts, pesticide use and the implications for biodiversity.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11625-020-00792-z.pdf,

By categorizing crops and evaluating the impact of frass, the research sheds light on its potential benefits and drawbacks in farming practices. Overall, understanding how black soldier fly frass can enhance soil fertility offers a sustainable solution for agriculture, reducing waste while promoting healthier crop growth. Abstract Hermetia illucens has received a lot of attention as its larval stage can grow on organic substrates, even those that are decomposing. Black soldier fly breeding provides a variety of valuable products, including frass, a mixture of larval excrements, larval exuviae, and leftover feedstock, that can be used as a fertilizer in agriculture. Organic fertilizers, such as frass, bringing beneficial bacteria and organic materials into the soil, improves its health and fertility.

Moreover, conventionally grown foods are less nutritious and contain lesser amounts of protective antioxidants. In the quest for safer food, the demand for organically grown foods has increased during the last decades due to their probable health benefits and food safety concerns. Organic food production is defined as cultivation without the application of chemical fertilizers and synthetic pesticides or genetically modified organisms, growth hormones, and antibiotics. The popularity of organically grown foods is increasing day by day owing to their nutritional and health benefits. Organic farming also protects the environment and has a greater socio-economic impact on a nation.

Good animal welfare promotes the healthy growth of poultry, which can reduce the disease rate and improve the production quality and capacity. As behaviour responses are an important expression of welfare, the study of behaviour is a simple and non-invasive method to assess animal welfare. The use of modern technology offers the possibility to monitor the behaviour of broilers and laying hens in a continuous and automated way. This paper reviews the latest technologies used for monitoring the behaviour of broilers and laying hens under both experimental conditions and commercial applications and discusses the potential of developing a precision livestock farming (PLF) system. The techniques that are presented and discussed include sound analysis, which can be an online tool to automatically monitor poultry behaviour non-invasively at the group level; wireless, wearable sensors with radio-frequency identification devices, which can automatically identify individual chickens, track the location and movement of individuals in real time and quantify some behavioural traits accordingly and image processing technology, which can be considered a direct tool for measuring behaviours, especially activity behaviours and disease early warning. All of these technologies can monitor and analyse poultry behaviour, at the group level or individual level, on commercial farms. However, the popularity and adoption of these technologies has been hampered by the logistics of applying them to thousands and tens of thousands of birds on commercial farms. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques in commercial applications and presents evidence that they provide potential tools to automatically monitor the behaviours of broilers and laying hens on commercial farms. However, there still has a long way to go to develop a PLF system to detect and predict abnormal situations.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1751731119002155,

Although bacteria are the most abundant component of microbiomes, and the most intensively studied, the microbiome also consists of viral, fungal, archael, and protozoan communities, about which comparatively little is known. Host-defense peptides (HDPs), originally described as antimicrobial, now have renewed significance as curators of the pervasive microbial loads required to maintain homeostasis and manage microbiome diversity. Harnessing HDP biology to transition away from non-selective, antibiotic-mediated treatments for clearance of microbes is a new paradigm, particularly in veterinary medicine. One family of evolutionarily conserved HDPs, β-defensins which are produced in diverse combinations by epithelial and immune cell populations, are multifunctional cationic peptides which manage the cross-talk between host and microbes and maintain a healthy yet dynamic equilibrium across mucosal systems. They are therefore key gatekeepers to the oral, respiratory, reproductive and enteric tissues, preventing pathogen-associated inflammation and disease and maintaining physiological normality. Expansions in the number of genes encoding these natural antibiotics have been described in the genomes of some species, the functional significance of which has only recently being appreciated. β-defensin expression has been documented pre-birth and disruptions in their regulation may play a role in maladaptive neonatal immune programming, thereby contributing to subsequent disease susceptibility. Here we review recent evidence supporting a critical role for β-defensins as farmers of the pervasive and complex prokaryotic ecosystems that occupy all body surfaces and cavities. We also share some new perspectives on the role of β-defensins as sensors of homeostasis and the immune vanguard particularly at sites of immunological privilege where inflammation is attenuated.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.03072/pdf,

The conventional method to control or prevent bacterial infections in farming is the use antibiotics. However, the banning of these compounds as growth promoters caused many changes in animal breeding and their use has since been limited to the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. In this function, their importance no longer needs to be demonstrated, but unfortunately, their excessive and abusive use have led to a double problem which can have harmful consequences on consumer health: Resistance to antibiotics and the presence of antibiotic residues in food. The use of probiotics appears to be a suitable alternative to overcome these problems because of their ability to modulate the immune system and intestinal microflora, and further considering their antagonistic role against certain pathogenic bacteria and their ability to play the role of growth factor (sometimes associated with prebiotics) when used as feed additives.

Researchers have used conventional and Machine Learning (ML)-based techniques for crop disease recognition and classification. However, these techniques are inaccurate and time-consuming due to the unavailability of quality data, inefficient preprocessing techniques, and the existing selection criteria of an efficient model. Therefore, a smart and intelligent system is needed which can accurately identify crop diseases.

Secondly, to accurately preprocess the data, specific segmentation and resizing methods are used to make differences between healthy and affected areas.

These adverse stimuli eventually translate into an imbalance in redox levels in the body, resulting in oxidative stress. The generation of oxidative stress, in turn, eventually causes damage to the pigs. To eliminate/reduce this harmful effect and counteract oxidative stress, pigs use part of the energy reserved for growth, which eventually leads to a decrease in production performance and causes unnecessary economic losses. Abstract Oxidative stress refers to the dramatic increase in the production of free radicals in human and animal bodies or the decrease in the ability to scavenging free radicals, thus breaking the antioxidation–oxidation balance. Various factors can induce oxidative stress in pig production. Oxidative stress has an important effect on pig performance and healthy growth, and has become one of the important factors restricting pig production. Based on the overview of the generation of oxidative stress, its effects on pigs, and signal transduction pathways, this paper discussed the nutritional measures to alleviate oxidative stress in pigs, in order to provide ideas for the nutritional research of anti-oxidative stress in pigs.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/5/1384/pdf?version=1620894794,

In agroecosystem, continuous manipulation of soil is going on due to addition of input, removal of nutrients, changing water balance, and microbial life. These processes affect soil properties (physical, chemical, and biological), and the deviation of these properties from the normal status is controlled by soil buffering capacity and soil resilience. If these changes are beyond the reach of soil resilience, then soil loses its original state, leading to soil degradation. At present, the extent of the degraded area in the world is 1,036 to 1,470 million ha. This urges the need for maintaining soil health rather than the mere addition of input for crop production. Soil health is an integrative property that reflects the capacity of soil to respond to agricultural intervention, so that it continues to support both agricultural production and the provision of other ecosystem services. Maintaining the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil is needed to keep it healthy, and this is possible through the adoption of different agronomic approaches. The diversification of nutrient sources with emphasis on organic sources, adoption of principles of conservation agriculture, enhancement of soil microbial diversity, efficient resource recycling through the integrated farming system, and amendment addition for correcting soil reactions are potential options for improving soil health, and are discussed in this review.

The agro-techniques such as green and brown manuring in arable land and agroforestry on degraded and marginal land were followed on piece meal basis and for economic gain. The potential of these and several other options for maintaining soil need to be recognized, evaluated, and quantified for their wider application on the front of soil health management avenues. The use of crop residue, agro-industrial waste, and untreated mineral or industrial waste (basic slag, phosphogypsum, etc.) as soil amendments has a huge potential in maintaining healthy soil along with serving as sources of crop nutrition. The review emphasizes the evaluation and quantification of present-day followed agro-techniques for their contribution to soil health improvement across agro-climatic regions and for wider implications. Furthermore, emphasis is given to innovative approaches for soil health management rather than mere application of manures and fertilizers for crop nutrition.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fagro.2021.680456/pdf,

The blue economy is expected to grow to USD2.5–3 trillion by 2030, and there is particular interest in its potential to alleviate poverty in Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, and to support a blue recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a selective, thematic review of the blue economy literature to examine: (i) the opportunities and risks for coastal communities, (ii) the barriers and enablers that shape community engagement, and (iii) the strategies employed by communities and supporting organizations, which can be strengthened to deliver a ‘sustainable' blue economy and improve social justice for coastal communities. Our review finds that under business-as-usual and blue growth, industrial fisheries, large-scale aquaculture, land reclamation, mining, and oil and gas raise red flags for communities and marine ecosystems. Whereas, if managed sustainably, small-scale fisheries, coastal aquaculture, seaweed farming and eco-tourism are the most likely to deliver benefits to communities. Yet, these are also the sectors most vulnerable to negative and cumulative impacts from other sectors. Based on our evaluation of enablers, barriers and strategies, the paper argues that putting coastal communities at the center of a clear vision for an inclusive Sustainable Blue Economy and co-developing a shared and accessible language for communities, practitioners and policy-makers is essential for a more equitable ocean economy, alongside mainstreaming social justice principles and integrated governance that can bridge different scales of action and opportunity.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpos.2022.1032204/pdf,

Advances in South African precision agriculture in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide spatially explicit near-real-time information that can be used to assess crop dynamics and inform smallholder farmers. The use of UAVs with remote-sensing techniques allows for the acquisition of high spatial resolution data at various spatio-temporal planes, which is particularly useful at the scale of fields and farms. Specifically, crop chlorophyll content is assessed as it is one of the best known and reliable indicators of crop health, due to its biophysical pigment and biochemical processes that indicate plant productivity. In this regard, the study evaluated the utility of multispectral UAV imagery using the random forest machine learning algorithm to estimate the chlorophyll content of maize through the various growth stages. The results showed that the near-infrared and red-edge wavelength bands and vegetation indices derived from these wavelengths were essential for estimating chlorophyll content during the phenotyping of maize. Furthermore, the random forest model optimally estimated the chlorophyll content of maize over the various phenological stages. Particularly, maize chlorophyll was best predicted during the early reproductive, late vegetative, and early vegetative growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 40.4 µmol/m−2, 39 µmol/m−2, and 61.6 µmol/m−2, respectively. The least accurate chlorophyll content results were predicted during the mid-reproductive and late reproductive growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 66.6 µmol/m−2 and 69.6 µmol/m−2, respectively, as a consequence of a hailstorm. A resultant chlorophyll variation map of the maize growth stages captured the spatial heterogeneity of chlorophyll within the maize field.

Proper nutrition is essential for the growth and development of the fish, and understanding their nutritional requirements is critical for producing healthy and high-quality fish. This review article provides an overview of the knowledge on the nutritional requirement of the African catfish, including protein, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. The recommended protein content for juvenile fish is between 40 and 50% and for adult fish is between 30 and 40%. Based on the reviewed studies, the recommended amount of methionine in C. gariepinus diets ranges from 18.7 to 29.7 g/kg of protein while the lysine requirement ranges from 44.9 to 62.2 g/kg protein). The recommended lipid content in the diet is between 5–15% for juvenile fish and 5–10% for adult fish. The African catfish requires a low-carbohydrate diet, with recommended carbohydrate content between 26 and 32%. They require a variety of vitamins, including vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin C, as well as minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Clarias gariepinus also require a variety of essential and non-essential amino acids. Besides the nutritional requirements, culture conditions also have a significant effect on the feed performance. The recommended conditions include temperature ranging from 28 to 32 °C, Light intensity of 150 Lx, 12D:12L photoperiod, and stocking density in earthen of 7 fish m−3.

Together with an extensive literature review, we investigated a time series of Thai aquaculture production data from 1995 to 2015. Overall, Thai aquaculture production has significantly increased during the last few decades and significantly contributed to socio-economic development. Estimates of total aquaculture production in Thailand have gradually grown from around 0.6 to 0.9 million tons over the last twenty years. Farmed shrimp is the main animal aquatic product, accounting for an estimated 40% of total yields of aquaculture production, closely followed by fish (38%) and mollusk (22%). Estimates over the past decades indicate that around 199470 ha of land is used for aquaculture farming. Out of the total area, 61% is used for freshwater farms, and 39% is used for coastal farms. However, this industry has contributed to environmental degradation, such as habitat destruction, water pollution, and ecological effects. Effective management strategies are urgently needed to minimize the environmental impacts of aquaculture and to ensure it maximally contributes to planetary health.

According to the study’s findings, in the case of the studied customers, people’s concerns about climate change, trust, and eco-labels demonstrate a stronger preference for purchasing organic food. It is also a surprise that customer trust has a big effect on consumer buying intention.

In recent decades, a third factor has been recognized in this system—the environment. For centuries, a side effect of agricultural development has been environmental pollution and the uncontrolled use of natural resources. New legislation is being introduced worldwide to protect the environment and move towards a sustainable economy. An example is the EU Green Deal, aimed at making Europe the world’s first climate-neutral continent. An integral part of this strategy is sustainable agriculture, based on a balanced use of resources, recycling, ecological practices and the latest technological solutions. It is also important to change the perception of soil and recognize its pivotal role in agricultural development and ensuring food security. Soil is a non-renewable natural resource; without healthy soil, no sustainable agriculture can exist. For this reason, this paper summarizes recent trends in the development of sustainable agriculture from the perspective of soil management and conservation. It includes a summary of nanomaterial use, organic farming, soil health, precision agriculture, and threats and challenges to soil sustainability posed by climate change.

Proso millet has multiple benefits when consumed as human food. Proso millet is rich in minerals, dietary fiber, polyphenols, vitamins and proteins. It is gluten-free and therefore, ideal for the gluten intolerant people. Proso millet contains high lecithin which supports the neural health system. It is rich in vitamins (niacin, B-complex vitamins, folic acid), minerals (P, Ca, Zn, Fe) and essential amino acids (methionine and cysteine). It has a low glycemic index and reduces the risk of type-2 diabetes. Unfortunately, in the USA, it is mostly considered as bird feed, whereas it is mainly used as human food in many other countries. Besides human health benefits, proso millet has an impeccable environmental benefit. Proso millet possesses many unique characteristics (e.g., drought tolerance, short-growing season) which makes it a promising rotational crop for winter wheat-based dryland farming systems. Proso millet provides the most economical production system when used in a two years wheat/summer fallow cropping system in semiarid High Plains of the USA. It helps in controlling winter annual grass weeds, managing disease and insect pressure and preserving deep soil moisture for wheat. Proso millet can also be used as a rotational crop with corn or sorghum owing to its tolerance for atrazine, the primary herbicide used in corn and sorghum production systems. Proso millet certainly is a climate-smart, gluten-free, ancient, and small grain cereal, which is healthy to humans and the environment. The main challenge is to expand the proso millet market beyond bird feed into the human food industry. To overcome the challenge, unique proso millet varieties for human food and ready-to-use multiple food products must be developed.

To improve feature extraction, the models were tweaked by changing their output layers with GlobalAverage Pooling2D, Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Dense layers. To take use of their complimentary qualities, the feature maps from both models were combined. This study uses a publicly available dataset from Kaggle for tomato leaf disease classification. Training on a dataset of 11,000 annotated pictures spanning 10 disease categories, including bacterial spot, early blight, late blight, leaf mold, septoria leaf spot, spider mites, target spot, yellow leaf curl virus, mosaic virus, and healthy leaves. Data preprocessing included image resizing and splitting, along with an 80-10-10 split, allocating 80% for training, 10% for testing, and 10% for validation to ensure a balanced evaluation. The proposed model with a 99.91% test accuracy, the suggested model was quite remarkable. Furthermore, guaranteeing strong classification performance across all disease categories, the model showed great precision (99.92%), recall (99.90%), and an F1-score of 99.91%. With few misclassifications, the confusion matrix verified almost flawless classification even further. These findings show how well deep learning can automate tomato disease diagnosis, therefore providing a scalable and quite accurate solution for smart agriculture.

It emphasizes that optimal dietary Se levels are necessary for healthy biological processes in fish, such as growth, reproduction, and immunity. Since organic Se appears to be the most ideal for fish due to its low toxicity, environmental safety, and efficient fish culture, it explores the potential sources and forms of Se. Extreme doses could be toxic to fish, and higher levels could cause retarded growth, survival issues, abnormalities, and poor performance. However, adverse effects depend on the acceptance of the fish species. Additionally, there are a number of biological techniques that may be used to remove excess Se from the aquatic environment, with phytoremediation being the most effective. The production of Se-rich feeds and their benefits for fish immune systems, disease prevention, and growth development are discussed in this article. These factors contribute to the profitability of fish farmers and their confidence in the feed industry. In order to monitor and study Se’s effects on fish and their aquatic environment, the report highlights the significance of the feed industry and how it connects farmers with research institutions. Abstract Dietary selenium (Se) is an essential component that supports fish growth and the immune system. This review attempts to provide insight into the biological impacts of dietary Se, including immunological responses, infection defense, and fish species growth, and it also identifies the routes via which it enters the aquatic environment. Dietary Se is important in fish feed due to its additive, antioxidant, and enzyme properties, which aid in various biological processes. However, excessive intake of it may harm aquatic ecosystems and potentially disrupt the food chain. This review explores the diverse natures of dietary Se, their impact on fish species, and the biological methods for eliminating excesses in aquatic environments. Soil has a potential role in the distribution of Se through erosion from agricultural, industrial, and mine sites. The research on dietary Se’s effects on fish immune system and growth can provide knowledge regarding fish health, fish farming strategies, and the health of aquatic ecosystems, promoting the feed industry and sustainable aquaculture. This review provides data and references from various research studies on managing Se levels in aquatic ecosystems, promoting fish conservation, and utilizing Se in farmed fish diets.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/18/2978/pdf?version=1695265432,

A few species of plants have the capability to grow in such a climate. However, those plants are not suitable as a food source. The aim of this work is to design and construct an indoor automatic vertical hydroponic system that does not depend on the outside climate. The designed system is capable to grow common type of crops that can be used as a food source inside homes without the need of large space. The design of the system was made after studying different types of vertical hydroponic systems in terms of price, power consumption and suitability to be built as an indoor automated system. A microcontroller was working as a brain of the system, which communicates with different types of sensors to control all the system parameters and to minimize the human intervention. An open internet of things (IoT) platform was used to store and display the system parameters and graphical interface for remote access. The designed system is capable of maintaining healthy growing parameters for the plants with minimal input from the user. The functionality of the overall system was confirmed by evaluating the response from individual system components and monitoring them in the IoT platform. The system was consuming 120.59 and 230.59 kWh respectively without and with air conditioning control during peak summer, which is equivalent to the system running cost of 13.26 and 25.36 Qatari Riyal (QAR) respectively. This system was circulating around 104 k gallons of nutrient solution monthly however, only 8–10 L water was consumed by the system. This system offers real-time notifications to alert the hydroponic system user when the conditions are not favorable. So, the user can monitor several parameters without using laboratory instruments, which will allow to control the entire system remotely. Moreover, the system also provides a wide range of information, which could be essential for plant researchers and provides a greater understanding of how the key parameters of hydroponic system correlate with plant growth. The proposed platform can be used both for quantitatively optimizing the setup of the indoor farming and for automating some of the most labor-intensive maintenance activities. Moreover, such a monitoring system can also potentially be used for high-level decision making, once enough data will be collected.

The number of people suffering or dying from diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, continues to rise, which is partly linked to overconsumption of highly processed foods, especially high-calorie orrapidly digestible foods. After falling for many years, the number of people suffering from starvation or malnutrition is rising, and this has been exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The highly integrated food supply chains that spread around the world are susceptible to disruptions due to policy changes, economic stresses, and natural disasters, as highlighted by the recent pandemic. In this perspective article, written by members of the Editorial Committee of the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, we highlight some of the major challenges confronting the modern food supply chain as well as how innovations in policy and technology can be used to address them. Pertinent technological innovations include robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced diagnostics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, gene editing, vertical farming, and soft matter physics. Many of these technologies are already being employed across the food chain by farmers, distributors, manufacturers, and consumers to improve the quality, nutrition, safety, and sustainability of the food supply. These innovations are required to stimulate the development and implementation of new technologies to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and efficient food production system. Where appropriate, these technologies should be carefully tested before widespread implementation so that proper risk-benefit analyses can be carried out. They can then be employed without causing unforeseen adverse consequences. Finally, it is important to actively engage all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain throughout the development and testing of these new technologies to support their adoption if proven safe and effective.

The severity of the impact of this disease on aquaculture worldwide has made it necessary to develop alternatives to prophylactic antibiotics use, such as the application of probiotics. To assess the potential to use probiotics in order to limit the detrimental effects of AHNPD, we evaluated the effect of the ILI strain, a Vibrio sp. bacterium and efficient shrimp probiotic, using metabarcoding (16S rRNA gene) on the gastrointestinal microbiota of shrimp after being challenged with AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus. We showed how the gastrointestinal microbiome of shrimp varied between healthy and infected organisms. Nevertheless, a challenge of working with AHPND-causing Vibrio pathogens and Vibrio-related bacteria as probiotics is the potential risk of the probiotic strain becoming pathogenic. Consequently, we evaluated whether ILI strain can acquire the plasmid pV-AHPND via horizontal transfer and further cause the disease in shrimp. Conjugation assays were performed resulting in a high frequency (70%) of colonies harboring the pv-AHPND. However, no shrimp mortality was observed when transconjugant colonies of the ILI strain were used in a challenge test using healthy shrimp. We sequenced the genome of the ILI strain and performed comparative genomics analyses using AHPND and non-AHPND Vibrio isolates. Using available phylogenetic and phylogenomics analyses, we reclassified the ILI strain as Vibrio diabolicus. In summary, this work represents an effort to study the role that probiotics play in the normal gastrointestinal shrimp microbiome and in AHPND-infected shrimp, showing that the ILI probiotic was able to control pathogenic bacterial populations in the host's gastrointestinal tract and stimulate the shrimp’s survival. The identification of probiotic bacterial species that are effective in the host’s colonization is important to promote animal health and prevent disease. This study describes probiotic bacteria capable of controlling pathogenic populations of bacteria in the shrimp gastrointestinal tract. Our work provides new insights into the complex dynamics between shrimp and the changes in the microbiota. It also addresses the practical application of probiotics to solve problems with pathogens that cause high mortality-rate in shrimp farming around the world. 5HokUSghi4XQ9JWVrk_iSc Video Abstract Video Abstract",https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40168-021-01043-8,

As the environment in vertical farming systems is completely controlled, neither sunlight nor soil is necessary. On the one hand, vertical farming may help to provide a healthy diet for the growing global population because it has a greater crop yield per square meter used than conventional farming; moreover, it can offer the opportunity to grow food in climatically disadvantaged areas. On the other hand, growth conditions may be perceived as unnatural and the entire vertical farming system as unsustainable. Therefore, understanding the consumers’ acceptance of vertical farming systems is important. This study is the first work to provide insights into consumers’ acceptance of three different vertical farming systems. Data are collected through an online survey of 482 consumers in Germany in February 2018. Drivers of consumer acceptance of vertical farming systems are identified through structural equation modelling. The results indicate that perceived sustainability is the major driver of consumer acceptance of vertical farming systems.

In this study, we adopt eight machine learning algorithms using an R software for analyzing a dataset of 14-dimensions of dairy cows with health disorders across the whole lactation period in intensive Chinese dairy farms, applying automatic monitoring systems and milking systems. The variables analyzed by the machine learning algorithms include milk yield, physical activity, changes in rumination time, and the electrical conductivity of milk. Six parameters were presented to evaluate the performance metrics of the models, with the Rpart algorithm outperforming others and indicating a strong generalization ability of this algorithm. A total of 10 variables of greater importance in three models of Rpart, eXtreme Gradient, and Adaboost demonstrated the consistency of those variables as predictors for disorders of dairy cows monitored by automatic systems. The results obtained in this study highlighted the importance of using big data on the farm to develop predictive and prescriptive decision support tools to boost the development of precision livestock farming. Abstract We use multidimensional data from automated monitoring systems and milking systems to predict disorders of dairy cows by employing eight machine learning algorithms. The data included the season, days in milking, parity, age at the time of disorders, milk yield (kg/day), activity (unitless), six variables related to rumination time, and two variables related to the electrical conductivity of milk. We analyze 131 sick cows and 149 healthy cows with identical lactation days and parity; all data are collected on the same day, which corresponds to the diagnosis day for disordered cows. For disordered cows, each variable, except the ratio of rumination time from daytime to nighttime, displays a decreasing/increasing trend from d-7 or d-3 to d0 and/or d-1, with the d0, d-1, or d-2 values reaching the minimum or maximum. The test data sensitivity for three algorithms exceeded 80%, and the accuracies of the eight algorithms ranged from 65.08% to 84.21%. The area under the curve (AUC) of the three algorithms was >80%. Overall, Rpart best predicts the disorders with an accuracy, precision, and AUC of 81.58%, 92.86%, and 0.908, respectively.

Usually, chickens are given minerals like calcium and iron from sources that can harm the environment and be costly. Microalgae offer a better solution as they are rich in these important minerals and can be grown sustainably, using less land and water. We studied different kinds of microalgae to see which ones have the best nutrients for chickens and how easily these nutrients can be absorbed. We also explored the costs and challenges of using microalgae in chicken feed on a large scale. Our review shows that while microalgae are a promising alternative, there are still economic and safety issues to solve before they can be widely used. The use of microalgae in chicken feed could lead to healthier chickens and a smaller environmental footprint, making this a valuable approach for sustainable farming and food production. Abstract This review explores the potential of microalgae as a sustainable and nutritionally rich alternative for mineral supplementation in poultry diets, addressing both the opportunities and challenges in this emerging field. Poultry nutrition, pivotal to the health and productivity of birds, traditionally relies on inorganic and organic mineral sources which, while effective, raise environmental and economic concerns. Microalgae offer a promising solution with their high contents of essential minerals, proteins, vitamins, and bioactive compounds. This review delves into the nutritional profiles of various microalgae, highlighting their rich contents of minerals which are crucial for physiological processes in poultry. It examines the bioavailability of these minerals and their impact on poultry health and productivity. Furthermore, it evaluates the environmental sustainability of microalgae cultivation and acknowledges the challenges in using microalgae in poultry diets, particularly in terms of the economic viability of large-scale production and the consistency of nutrient composition.

Early and accurate detection is essential for timely intervention and sustainable farming. This paper presents a review of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for crop disease diagnosis, focusing on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs), and deep models like VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. The review method includes an in-depth analysis of algorithm performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score across various datasets. We also highlight the data imbalances in commonly used datasets, particularly PlantVillage, and discuss the challenges posed by these imbalances. The research highlights critical insights regarding ML and DL models in crop disease detection. A primary challenge identified is the imbalance in the PlantVillage dataset, with a high number of healthy images and a strong bias toward certain disease categories like fungi, leaving other categories like mites and molds underrepresented. This imbalance complicates model generalization, indicating a need for preprocessing steps to enhance performance. This study also shows that combining Vision Transformers (ViTs) with Green Chromatic Coordinates and hybridizing these with SVM achieves high classification accuracy, emphasizing the value of advanced feature extraction techniques in improving model efficacy. In terms of comparative performance, DL architectures like ResNet50, VGG16, and convolutional neural network demonstrated robust accuracy (95–99%) across diverse datasets, underscoring their effectiveness in managing complex image data. Additionally, traditional ML models exhibited varied strengths; for instance, SVM performed better on balanced datasets, while RF excelled with imbalanced data. Preprocessing methods like K-means clustering, Fuzzy C-Means, and PCA, along with ensemble approaches, further improved model accuracy. Lastly, the study underscores that high-quality, well-labeled datasets, stakeholder involvement, and comprehensive evaluation metrics such as F1 score and precision are crucial for optimizing ML and DL models, making them more effective for real-world applications in sustainable agriculture.",,

Fortunately, scientists and engineers are making great strides to introduce farming innovations to tackle the challenge. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is among the innovations and thus is widely applied for crop health monitoring and phenotyping. This study demonstrated the versatility of aerial remote sensing in diagnosing yellow rust infection in spring wheats in a timely manner and determining an intervenable period to prevent yield loss. A small UAV equipped with an aerial multispectral sensor periodically flew over, and collected remotely sensed images of, an experimental field in Chacabuco (−34.64; −60.46), Argentina during the 2021 growing season. Post-collection images at the plot level were engaged in a thorough feature-engineering process by handcrafting disease-centric vegetation indices (VIs) from the spectral dimension, and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features from the spatial dimension. A machine learning pipeline entailing a support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) was constructed to identify locations of healthy, mild infection, and severe infection plots in the field. A custom 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) relying on the feature learning mechanism was an alternative prediction method. The study found red-edge (690–740 nm) and near infrared (NIR) (740–1000 nm) as vital spectral bands for distinguishing healthy and severely infected wheats. The carotenoid reflectance index 2 (CRI2), soil-adjusted vegetation index 2 (SAVI2), and GLCM contrast texture at an optimal distance d = 5 and angular direction θ = 135° were the most correlated features. The 3D-CNN-based wheat disease monitoring performed at 60% detection accuracy as early as 40 days after sowing (DAS), when crops were tillering, increasing to 71% and 77% at the later booting and flowering stages (100–120 DAS), and reaching a peak accuracy of 79% for the spectral-spatio-temporal fused data model. The success of early disease diagnosis from low-cost multispectral UAVs not only shed new light on crop breeding and pathology but also aided crop growers by informing them of a prevention period that could potentially preserve 3–7% of the yield at the confidence level of 95%.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/13/3301/pdf?version=1687875675,

The worldwide population is projected to increase to 9 billion by 2050 (United Nations 2015). To accommodate this increase, food production will necessarily need to increase as well. However, new agricultural land is limited, so sustainable production and increasing productivity of existing agricultural land is an important aspect to addressing global food security (Popp et al. 2013). Food security has been described as a condition of humanity “...when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.” (Food and Agriculture Organization 1996). Increases in the terrestrial agricultural production of food and fish farming will be necessary to ensure adequate food availability, but this is only part of the larger concept of food security that also comprises food access, utilization, and stability (Food and Agriculture Organization 2006). Given that there is limited additional land available for agriculture and sites for fish farming coupled with increasing economic pressures to produce agricultural commodities for industrial purposes, including fiber and biofuels, strategies to increase agricultural yield will need to be used to meet the increase in food demand for the immediate future. For the near and foreseeable future, pesticides may be an important component of a comprehensive strategy to increase crop yield by preventing both pre and postharvest loss to pests. With the role that pesticides may have to play to provide food security for an increasing world population, our commentary focuses on the important contribution epidemiology can make in helping to inform environmental health policy to safely meet the many challenges involved with ensuring food security.",https://doi.org/10.1002/fes3.112,

However, its role in healthy people is probably under-appreciated. The complex epidemiology of this protozoan recognizes several infection routes but consumption of contaminated food is likely to be the predominant one. Among food, consumption of raw and undercooked meat is a relevant route of transmission, but the role of different meat producing animal species and meats thereof is controversial. Objectives The aim of the present work is to summarize and analyse literature data reporting prevalence estimates of T. gondii in meat animals/meats. Data Sources We searched Medline, Web of Science, Science Direct (last update 31/03/2015). Eligibility Criteria Relevant papers should report data from primary studies dealing with the prevalence of T. gondii in meat from livestock species as obtained through direct detection methods. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed. Results Of 1915 papers screened, 69 papers were included, dealing mainly with cattle, pigs and sheep. Pooled prevalences, based on random-effect models, were 2.6% (CI95 [0.5–5.8]) for cattle, 12.3% (CI95 [7.6–17.8]) for pigs and 14.7% (CI95 [8.9–21.5]) for sheep. Due to the high heterogeneity observed, univariable and multivariable meta-regression models were fitted showing that the geographic area for cattle (p = 0.032), the farming type for pigs (p = 0.0004) and the sample composition for sheep (p = 0.03) had significant effects on the prevalences of Toxoplasma detected/estimated. Moreover, the role of different animal species was dependent on the geographic location of animals’ origin. Limitations Limitations were due mainly to a possible publication bias. Conclusions and Implications The present work confirms the role of meat, including beef, as T. gondii sources, and highlights the need for a control system for this parasite to be implemented along the meat production chain. Moreover, consumer knowledge should be strengthened in order to reduce the impact of disease.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153856&type=printable,

Heart- and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is an emerging disease in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming. HSMI is associated with Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) infection, but PRV is ubiquitous in farmed Atlantic salmon and thus present also in apparently healthy individuals. This has brought speculations if additional etiological factors are required, and experiments focusing on the causal relationship between PRV and HSMI are highly warranted. A major bottleneck in PRV research has been the lack of cell lines that allow propagation of the virus. To bypass this, we propagated PRV in salmon, bled the fish at the peak of the infection, and purified virus particles from blood cells. Electron microscopy, western blot and high-throughput sequencing all verified the purity of the viral particles. Purified PRV particles were inoculated into naïve Atlantic salmon. The purified virus replicated in inoculated fish, spread to naïve cohabitants, and induced histopathological changes consistent with HSMI. PRV specific staining was demonstrated in the pathological lesions. A dose-dependent response was observed; a high dose of virus gave earlier peak of the viral load and development of histopathological changes compared to a lower dose, but no difference in the severity of the disease.

From a sustainability perspective, organic farming offers an eco-friendly cultivation system that minimizes agrochemicals and producing food with little or no environmental footprint. However, organic agriculture’s biggest drawback is the generally lower and variable yield in contrast to conventional farming. Compatible with organic farming, the selective use of biostimulants can close the apparent yield gap between organic and conventional cultivation systems. A biostimulant is defined as natural microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) or biologically active substances that are able to improve plant growth and yield through several processes. Biostimulants are derived from a range of natural resources including organic materials (composts, seaweeds), manures (earthworms, fish, insects) and extracts derived from microbes, plant, insect or animal origin. The current trend is indicative that a mixture of biostimulants is generally delivering better growth, yield and quality rather than applying biostimulant individually. When used correctly, biostimulants are known to help plants cope with stressful situations like drought, salinity, extreme temperatures and even certain diseases. More research is needed to understand the different biostimulants, key components, and also to adjust the formulations to improve their reliability in the field. Abstract Demand for organically grown food crops is rising substantially annually owing to their contributions to human health. However, organic farm production is still generally lower compared to conventional farming. Nutrient availability, content consistency, uptake, assimilation, and crop responses to various stresses were reported as critical yield-limiting factors in many organic farming systems. In recent years, plant biostimulants (BSs) have gained much interest from researchers and growers, and with the objective of integrating these products to enhance nutrient use efficiency (NUE), crop performance, and delivering better stress resilience in organic-related farming. This review gave an overview of direct and indirect mechanisms of microbial and non-microbial BSs in enhancing plant nutrient uptake, physiological status, productivity, resilience to various stressors, and soil-microbe-plant interactions. BSs offer a promising, innovative and sustainable strategy to supplement and replace agrochemicals in the near future. With greater mechanistic clarity, designing purposeful combinations of microbial and non-microbial BSs that would interact synergistically and deliver desired outcomes in terms of acceptable yield and high-quality products sustainably will be pivotal. Understanding these mechanisms will improve the next generation of novel and well-characterized BSs, combining microbial and non-microbial BSs strategically with specific desired synergistic bio-stimulatory action, to deliver enhanced plant growth, yield, quality, and resilience consistently in organic-related cultivation.",https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/11/1/41/pdf?version=1640752263,

Furthermore, households in poor countries may depend on small-scale corn cultivation for their basic needs. However, corn crops are vulnerable to diseases, which greatly affects farming yields. Moreover, extreme weather conditions and unseasonable temperatures can accelerate the spread of diseases. The pervasiveness and ubiquity of technology have allowed for the deployment of technological innovations in many areas. Particularly, applications powered by artificial intelligence algorithms have established themselves in many disciplines relating to image, signal, and sound recognition. In this work, we target the application of deep transfer learning in the classification of three corn diseases (i.e., Cercospora leaf spot, common rust, and northern leaf blight) in addition to the healthy plants. Using corn leaf image as input and convolutional neural networks models, no preprocessing or explicit feature extraction was required. Transfer learning using well-established and well-designed deep learning models was performed and extensively evaluated using multiple scenarios for splitting the data. In addition, the experiments were repeated 10 times to account for variability in picking random choices. The four classes were discerned with a mean accuracy of 98.6%. This and the other performance metrics exhibit values that make it feasible to build and deploy applications that can aid farmers and plant pathologists to promptly and accurately perform disease identification and apply the correct remedies.",https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/11/20/2668/pdf?version=1666167967,

Salmon farming in Chile is a clear example of the above statement, where more than 5,500 tonnes of antibiotics have been used over the last 10 years. This has caused a great impact both at the production level and on the environment; however, there are still few works in relation to it. In order to demonstrate the impact of the high use of antibiotics on fish gut microbiota, we have selected four salmon farms presenting a similar amount of fish of the Atlantic salmon species (Salmo salar), ranging from 4,500 to 6,000 tonnes. All of these farms used treatments with high doses of antibiotics. Thus, 15 healthy fish were selected and euthanised in order to isolate the bacteria resistant to the antibiotics oxytetracycline and florfenicol from the gut microbiota. In total, 47 bacterial isolates resistant to florfenicol and 44 resistant to oxytetracycline were isolated, among which isolates with Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) exceeding 2048 μg/mL for florfenicol and 1024 μg/mL for oxytetracycline were found. In addition, another six different antibiotics were tested in order to demonstrate the multiresistance phenomenon. In this regard, six isolates of 91 showed elevated resistance values for the eight tested antibiotics, including florfenicol and oxytetracycline, were found. These bacteria were called “super-resistant” bacteria. This phenotypic resistance was verified at a genotypic level since most isolates showed antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to florfenicol and oxytetracycline. Specifically, 77% of antibiotic resistant bacteria showed at least one gene resistant to florfenicol and 89% showed at least one gene resistant to oxytetracycline. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the high use of the antibiotics florfenicol and oxytetracycline has, as a consequence, the selection of multiresistant bacteria in the gut microbiota of farmed fish of the Salmo salar species at the seawater stage. Also, the phenotypic resistance of these bacteria can be correlated with the presence of antibiotic resistance genes.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203641&type=printable,

Organic farming production system is being promoted as a low cost environment friendly production system for, improved human and soil health, better environment, and increased agricultural sustainability. The reviewed literature is in consensus that organic farming, undoubtedly, improves soil quality due to application of organic manures and composts, and adoption of legume-based diversified cropping systems. Conversely, there is also consensus on lower productivity of crops (5–58%) under organic farming than the conventional system though exceptions are there. Despite the lower crop productivity, it may become more profitable if price premiums are available on organic produce. Its role in improving nutritional quality of produce though is debatable; but owing to absence of synthetic inputs organic produce is generally considered to be safer and healthy. The organic farming practices are expected to improve the soil quality over imbalanced and discriminate use of agro-chemical inputs. In sole productivity terms, organic farming may not be a viable farming system but in terms of overall ecosystem services, the system definitely has an edge over the conventional system.",,

Detection of disease and healthy monitoring of plant are major challenges for sustainable agriculture. Hence there is need to detect plant disease automatically using image processing technique at an early stage with more accuracy. It involves image acquisition, image pre-processing, image segmentation, feature extraction and classification of disease. To increase the quality of produce and yield, a regular monitoring technique for detection of diseases in plants becomes essential. The digital image processing system is one such powerful technique to diagnose the difficult symptoms much earlier than the human eye could recognize.

The health focus of the study is on asthma and allergic symptoms among small children and their parents. The first step in the study was an epidemiological cross-sectional questionnaire on housing and health involving 14,077 preschool children in the county of Värmland in Sweden (March-April 2000). Self-reported moisture-related problems in the building were strongly associated with asthma, allergic symptoms, and airway infections among children and adults. Other factors associated with symptoms among the children were allergic heredity, smoking in the family, male sex, urban living, short breast feeding, pet keeping, daycare attendance, non-farming life and some food habits. The second step in the study was a nested case-control study including 198 children with symptoms and 202 healthy controls. A detailed clinical examination by physicians in parallel with extensive inspections and measurements in the subjects' homes were conducted from October 2001 to April 2002. The influence of selection bias in case-control studies has been studied, and questionnaires on self-reported symptoms and building characteristics have been validated. Identified risk factors for allergic symptoms are, e.g., inspector-observed dampness, a low ventilation rate, endotoxin, Penicillium and phthalates in dust. In the third phase, a 5-year follow-up study will be carried out during 2005. The same questionnaire as used in DBH-phase 1 will be distributed to the 10,852 children/parents who responded to the first questionnaire in 2000. Finally, in a fourth phase, controlled experimental studies in climate chambers and in vitro tests regarding findings from DBH-Phase 2 are planned to be conducted during 2004-08. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Asthma and allergies among small children are associated with a number of risk factors in the indoor environment. In investigations of building-related health problems many factors have to be considered, including ""dampness"" emissions from building materials, and ventilation rates.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00274.x,

However, there is currently a lack of guidance and support on assessing the influence that the life cycle of products and services has on the SDGs. This article presents a case study where Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) is applied to understand the social performance of a textile product and its potential contribution to the SDGs. In this study, the link between the S-LCA methodology and the SDG framework was made at the indicator level, through a new classification of S-LCA indicators. This classification was aimed at indicating the positive or negative contribution of products or services into the SDGs. The method was tested with the case study of a man’s shirt whose supply chain takes place across five countries, from the cotton farming in China to the retailing in The Netherlands. The social performance of the shirt’s life cycle was analyzed through a social hotspot assessment (using PSILCA database) and a site-specific assessment following the UNEP/SETAC S-LCA guidelines. Primary data was collected for 6 different suppliers regarding 51 social indicators and four stakeholder categories (workers, local communities, value chain actors, and society). The social hotspot assessment indicated high social risks on indicators related to the following SDGs: health and well-being, affordable and clean energy, decent work, and responsible production and consumption. These risks were mainly located in Bangladesh (shirt manufacturing) and Malaysia (fabric manufacturing). The site-specific assessment indicated different results than the social risk assessment, showing worse social performance in the spinning stage (located in China). Negative scores were obtained for every supplier in at least four indicators, including working hours, safe and healthy living conditions, and access to immaterial resources. The results indicated negative social performance of the supply chain in most of the SDGs and identified points of improvement for the final retailer. The linkage of the S-LCA framework with the SDGs presented methodological challenges, mainly related to the different scope of the SDG indicators and the S-LCA indicators.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11367-020-01789-7.pdf,

Soil health is evaluated with respect to sustainable crop production but can be extended to other ecosystem functions. The OSI leverages the existing knowledge base of agronomic research and routine laboratory data, enabling its application with limited cost. The OSI is a generic framework that can be adopted for specific regions with specific objectives. As a proof of concept, the OSI is implemented for all (>700,000) Dutch agricultural fields and illustrated with 11 pairs (“good” and “poor”) of local fields and 32 fields where soil quality and crop yield have been monitored. The OSI produced reasonable evaluation for most pairs when soil physical functions were refined with on-site soil visual assessment.

Healthy soil is one of the most important pillars of sustainability as it delivers several ecosystem services along with its control on microbial activity, nutrient recycling, and decomposition. Nature‐based solutions can play an important role in restoring soil quality for enhanced agricultural productivity and sustainability. This article discusses various nature‐based options available for improving soil quality. Indigenous practices such as sheep penning, tank silt application, green manuring, and refuse from croplands and households have the potential to restore and maintain soil fertility. Biofertilizers can add nutrients (N fixers), fixe up to 300 kg N ha through biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and facilitate (nutrient solubilizer and mobilizers) nutrient availability in the soil. Biochar, a commonly used product, can increase soil moisture availability by 8%–10% and aids in mitigating climate change through C‐sequestration. Biochar may have a climate change mitigation potential of 1.8 Pg CO2‐C equivalent per year. When added to the soil, it not only acts as a nutrient source; but also acts as a soil amendment. Biogas slurry, the effluent from biogas reactors, contains various nutrient elements that can enrich soil fertility. The holistic approach in a farming system, through integration of different enterprises, reduces dependence on off‐farm resources. Soil management through nature‐based options will maintain crop productivity and sustainability in the long run without any adverse effects on the environment.",,

As a wild edible species, it is a promising alternative to substitute conventional crops in harsh conditions due to its resilience to adverse conditions. In the present review, we tried to compile the most up-to-date literature regarding the management and cultivation practices of Portulaca oleracea. The presented information will be useful to farmers and stakeholders for the commercial cultivation of the species and its introduction as a complementary/alternative crop in the current production systems, while at the same time could be used for the phytoremediation and reclamation of degraded and abandoned agricultural land. Abstract Soil is an essential resource, and its degradation is challenging modern agriculture, while its impact is expected to increase in the near future. One of the strategies to address this issue is to incorporate new alternative crops able to tolerate arduous conditions, as well as for the use of sustainable agricultural practices in order to recover and/or improve soil health. Additionally, the increasing market for new functional/healthy natural foods promotes the search for potential alternative crop species with promising bioactive compounds content. For this purpose, wild edible plants are a key option because they have already been consumed for hundreds of years in traditional gastronomy and there is well-established evidence of their health-promoting effects. Moreover, since they are not a cultivated species, they are able to grow under natural conditions without human intervention. Among them, common purslane is an interesting wild edible species and a good candidate for integration in commercial farming systems. With worldwide spread, it is able to tolerate drought, salinity and heat stress and is already used in traditional dishes, while it is highly appreciated for its high nutritional value due to its bioactive compound content, especially omega-3 fatty acids. In this review, we aim to present the breeding and cultivation practices of purslane, as well as the effects of abiotic stressors on yield and chemical composition of the edible parts. Finally, we present information that helps to optimize purslane cultivation and facilitate its management in degraded soils for their exploitation in the existing farming systems.",https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/12/6/1246/pdf?version=1678355047,

Tempranillo and Airen are very dominant in Spain. They are planted on almost 45% of the Spanish Vineland. Rrebbiano in Italy is the same as Ugni Blanc in France. In Italy, it is responsible for many white wines of rather a bland character. In France, it is used for Cognac and the producers there like it precisely for its blandness. But it does make a good Cognac. Grapes are grown in all countries of the world and give more money than the other crops to farmers. In Pakistan in the Area of Shekhpura one farmer told that it give 14 times more income than the wheat. In Pakistan it is mostly grown in Baluchistan while in Sind area some projects are working for grape production enhancement. Similarly grape has some essential elements which play great role in health problems. From grapes wines are prepared which give more income to European countries. It needs very less water till maturity. It has two types namely table grapes and non table grapes in the world. It also help in diabetes and blood pressures while play great role in heart problems. In France more people use grapes so there the problems of heart is very less than the other countries. Resvratrol also present in the grape which has anti-cancer properties and is very healthy for the glands and large intestine. “It is also beneficial to combat heart diseases, diseases of the nervous system, Alzheimer’s disease, viral infections and fungal infections. Resveratrol reduces the risk of paralysis by improving the molecular mechanism in the veins. So the discussion shows that grape is very important fruit of the world while sometime it is called king of the fruit. .According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 75,866 square kilometres of the world are dedicated to grapes. Approximately 71% of world grape production is used for wine, 27% as fresh fruit, and 2% as dried fruit. Raw grapes are 81% water, 18% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and have negligible fat. The farmers of the world are very poor and have no access to credit , so it is requested of the world bank to give proper loan to the world farmer for grapes grown, to in time purchase the inputs and in time marketed to the consumers in the world to earn money for their farming uplifting. Some pest also attacked on the grape and decreases the production of the farmer. The grape leaf hopper is the common insect pest feed on the vines from the time leaves appear in the spring until they drop in the fall. They remove the green chlorophyll, and the whole leaf may become pale, die and turn brown. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease prevalent on grapes. Any portion of plant such as leaves, blossom, fruit and young shoots may be affected. A white patch appearance may be noted on leaves young shoots; blossom fails to set fruit. Young berries attacked by this fungus may drop, or become hardened, discolored and cracked. To control powdery mildew apply fungicides before symptoms appear. Root knot caused by a gall-forming nematode may become a problem in sandy and sandy loam soil, resulting in a decline in vine vigor and reduction in yields. Resistant root-stocks should be used for grape production. Through fumigation the disease of the grapes should be controlled. So it is the duty of the government to controls the mentioned problems in their countries for enhancing of grape production. Every government should focus on this fruit and arrange propagation program in their countries because it give more benefit to the farmers instead of Wheat. Through this way industries will be developed and employment will be generated which play great role in the solution of unemployment problem in the country. In European countries the government mostly focuses on this fruit while in developing countries the program for grape is very slow, so it is the duty of every government in the world to spend more money on grape for enhancing grape industries in the developing countries. They are very poor and they have no access to credit and because of less money they did not start the grape program on their farm.",,

Research has shown that relative to conventional agriculture, organic farming is more efficient in its use of non-renewable energy, maintains or improves soil quality, and has less of a detrimental effect on water quality and biodiversity. Studies have had more mixed findings, however, when examining the impact of organic farming on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change. Life cycle assessments (LCAs) in particular have indicated that organic farming can often result in higher GHG emissions per unit product as a result of lower yields. The organic movement has the opportunity to embrace the science of LCA and use this information in developing tools for site-specific assessments that can point toward strategies for improvements. Responding effectively to the climate change crisis should be at the core of the organic movement’s values. Additionally, while societal-level behavioral and policy changes will be required to reduce waste and shift diets to achieve essential reductions in GHG emissions throughout food systems, organic farming should be open to seriously considering emerging technologies and methods to improve its performance and reduce GHG emissions at the production stage.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/17/7012/pdf,

As there are limited data focusing on the factors influencing safety behavior toward pesticide use in Morocco, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in 15 rural communities of Morocco’s Fes Meknes region to assess the attitudes, knowledge, and practices regarding pesticide use. A structured questionnaire was completed, containing the data of the interviewed farmers, their behavior towards safety measures, the type of active ingredient used, as well as the perception of risks to their own health following exposure to pesticides by the existence of chronic, self-perceived symptoms. Non-probability (empirical) sampling with the quota method was carried out, which consists of constructing the sample. Results showed that most respondents have not been trained in the application of pesticides, with almost half of the farmers using a category of pesticides which are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as probable human carcinogenic (i.e., Glyphosate, Malathion). In terms of pesticide storage, 40% of farmers said that they did not store pesticides in a separate room after purchasing or using them. The empty containers were buried or burnt by half of the responders, while the remainder were thrown at the edge of fields or in public dumps. Although the participants were aware of the negative effects on their own health and on the environment caused by the application of pesticides in use, the protection measures by individual equipment were insufficient. A canonical analysis indicates that these behaviors were influenced by the farming experience, the benefit of the agricultural council services, the follow-up of training, and the education level. These variables are important factors in explaining and understanding the dangers to both the environment and health caused by pesticides. The most recorded likely consequences of pesticide exposure were visual impairment (46%), followed by dizziness (44.3%), headache (39.4%), and excessive sweating (34.4%), and 30.2% of participants identified consequent respiratory problems.

The latter is exacerbating the overexploitation of natural resources, thus increasing the environmental impact of animal farming, as well as the prices of raw materials. In this sense, insects have been indicated as one of the possible alternatives to solve this problem, thus research efforts to test the feasibility of a practical application to the poultry sector are required. Therefore, the present study tested different inclusion levels of a defatted black soldier fly larvae protein meal in the diets for laying quails as an alternative ingredient to the soybean meal and oil. Results of the present study showed that the insect meal can technically be applied to laying quails’ feed formulations, providing optimal performance and health status. Egg nutritional quality and sensory profile too did not worsen when quails were fed with the insect meal supplementation. Further research efforts should be performed to improve the healthiness of the lipid fraction of the tested insect larvae and, in turn, the lipid quality of the eggs obtained from insect-fed quails. Abstract Insects are promising candidates as alternative sustainable sources of protein for poultry species. The present research studied the effect of a dietary inclusion of a defatted black soldier fly (BSF) larvae meal as an alternative protein source in the diets of laying quails, on productive performance, egg physicochemical quality, fatty acid profile, sensory traits and storage stability. A total of 225 laying quails were divided into 3 dietary groups (5 replicates/each). A conventional soybean meal-based diet was formulated (Control group), and two other diets were formulated including either 10% (BSF10) or 15% (BSF15) defatted BSF larvae meal. Laying quails showed satisfactory productive performance throughout the trial. BSF10 and BSF15 eggs had the highest shape index (p < 0.01), shell weight and percentage (p < 0.001) and the most intense yolk color (p < 0.001). Defatted BSF larvae meal increased the eggs’ saturated fatty acid content (p < 0.001) to the detriment of the polyunsaturated fraction (p < 0.001). Overall the eggs’ sensory profile was not affected by the dietary treatment, but BSF15 eggs had a higher feed off-flavor vs Control group (p < 0.05). At day 28 of storage, oxidative stability was higher in BSF10 vs. Control eggs (p < 0.01). Defatted BSF larvae meal can be considered a possible alternative ingredient to soybean meal in laying quail diets, up to the 15% inclusion level.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/9/3/115/pdf?version=1553512397,

The management of P waste is critical to solving these problems. In this study, we quantified the historic trends of P waste generation and recycling in China. From 1900 to 2015, the annual generation of P waste increased from 1 Mt P to 12 Mt P. Crop farming was the largest P waste source in most years, while P waste from phosphate mining and phosphorus chemical production increased the fastest. The total recycled P waste increased five-fold, but phosphorus loss increased 26-fold. In 2015, 28% of the P waste was lost on cultivated land, and 21% was lost on non-arable land. The largest phosphorus contributor to inland water changed from crop farming to aquaculture. The full recycling of P waste would have reduced phosphate consumption by more than 1/3 in 2015. The results of a scenario analysis showed that a healthier diet would greatly increase the generation and loss of P waste, but balanced fertilization could reduce the generation of P waste by 17% and promoting waste recycling could reduce the phosphorus loss by 35%.",,

Today, most crops receive suboptimal pollination because of limited abundance and diversity of pollinating insects. Animal pollinators are currently suffering owing to a host of direct and indirect anthropogenic pressures: land-use change, intensive farming techniques, harmful pesticides, nutritional stress, and climate change, among others. Objectives: We aimed to model the impacts on current global human health from insufficient pollination via diet. Methods: We used a climate zonation approach to estimate current yield gaps for animal-pollinated foods and estimated the proportion of the gap attributable to insufficient pollinators based on existing research. We then simulated closing the “pollinator yield gaps” by eliminating the portion of total yield gaps attributable to insufficient pollination. Next, we used an agriculture–economic model to estimate the impacts of closing the pollinator yield gap on food production, interregional trade, and consumption. Finally, we used a comparative risk assessment to estimate the related changes in dietary risks and mortality by country and globally. In addition, we estimated the lost economic value of crop production for three diverse case-study countries: Honduras, Nepal, and Nigeria. Results: Globally, we calculated that 3%–5% of fruit, vegetable, and nut production is lost due to inadequate pollination, leading to an estimated 427,000 (95% uncertainty interval: 86,000, 691,000) excess deaths annually from lost healthy food consumption and associated diseases. Modeled impacts were unevenly distributed: Lost food production was concentrated in lower-income countries, whereas impacts on food consumption and mortality attributable to insufficient pollination were greater in middle- and high-income countries with higher rates of noncommunicable disease. Furthermore, in our three case-study countries, we calculated the economic value of crop production to be 12%–31% lower than if pollinators were abundant (due to crop production losses of 3%–19%), mainly due to lost fruit and vegetable production. Discussion: According to our analysis, insufficient populations of pollinators were responsible for large present-day burdens of disease through lost healthy food consumption. In addition, we calculated that low-income countries lost significant income and crop yields from pollinator deficits. These results underscore the urgent need to promote pollinator-friendly practices for both human health and agricultural livelihoods. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10947",https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp10947,

This sibship size association for hay fever, since replicated many times in Britain and other affluent countries and confirmed by objective measures of atopy, prompted what has come to be known as the “hygiene hypothesis for allergy”, although that term was not specifically used in the 1989 paper. The present paper reviews the historical roots of the “hygiene hypothesis” and charts its development over more than 30 years. Initial scepticism among immunologists turned to enthusiasm in the mid-1990s as the Th1/Th2 paradigm for allergic sensitisation emerged from animal experiments and the concept of “immunological old friends” became popular from the early 2000s. From the late 1990s, observations of reduced allergy risk among children of anthroposophic families and those brought up on farms suggested that the sibship size effects formed part of a broader range of “hygiene-related” determinants of allergy. Children from large families with farming exposure have approximately sixfold reduction in prevalence of hay fever, indicating the potential strength and epidemiological importance of these environmental determinants. During the 21st century, a wide range of specific microbial, environmental and lifestyle factors have been investigated as possible underlying mechanisms, but sadly none have emerged as robust explanations for the family size and farming effects. Thus, while the “hygiene hypothesis” led to a fundamental reappraisal of our relationship with our microbial environment and to the concept that early exposure, rather than avoidance, is beneficial for developing a healthy immune system, the underlying mechanism for variations in allergy prevalence with family size remains, in Churchillian terms, “a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma”.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/falgy.2022.1051368/pdf,

Nine healthy multiparous Holstein cows (parity = 3) with similar body weights (584 ± 12.3 kg), days in milk (108 ± 11.4), and milk yields (30 ± 1.93 kg; all mean ± standard deviation) were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 3 periods of 21 d. During each period, each group consumed 1 of 3 diets: (1) 0% IHEEB (0IHEEB); (2) 6.0% IHEEB and 1.7% Chinese wildrye hay (6IHEEB); (3) 10.8% IHEEB and 4.3% Chinese wildrye hay (11IHEEB). The diets in each group were isocaloric and isonitrogenous, with similar contents of concentrate and silage but different ratios of IHEEB and CWH to replace AH. The results showed that increasing the substitute did not affect the total-tract apparent nutrient digestibility. There was no difference in lactation performance of dairy cows fed the three diets, except for the cows' somatic cell count (SCC), which decreased with the increase in the amount of the substitute. Cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol were not detected in milk samples of dairy cows in the different treatment groups. 6IHEEB and 11IHEEB-fed cows showed a linear decrease in total volatile fatty acids (VFA) and butyrate compared to the 0IHEEB cows. Plasma IL-1β content quadratically decreased with feeding IHEEB and CWH, and other blood parameters were unaffected. The rumen fluid's relative abundances of Bacteroidota, Fibrobacterota, and Prevotellaceae quadratically increased, while Firmicutes tended to decrease quadratically as the substitution increased. Feeding IHEEB and CWH linearly increased the relative abundances of Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, Monoglobaceae, and Butyricicoccaceae in the feces. As the substitution increased, the cost of dairy farming was reduced.

Metritis and endometritis are major problems in intensive dairy farming at present and cause significant long-term economic losses. Therefore, the efficient treatment and prevention of uterine diseases in the peri- and postpuerperal periods are essential. The use of antibiotics in these disease conditions is limited, either due to their limited effectiveness or due to recent legislation intended to reduce the use of antimicrobials. Therefore, finding efficient alternatives to antibiotics is necessary. This literature review provides an overview of the current and future possibilities for the non-antibiotic-based control of metritis and endometritis in dairy cows. Abstract Uterine disease is an intensely studied part of dairy cattle health management as it heavily affects many commercial dairy farms and has serious economic consequences. Forms of the disease, pathophysiology, pathogens involved and the effects of uterine disease on the health and performance of cows have already been well described by various authors. Lately, researchers’ attention has shifted towards the healthy microbiome of the uterus and the vagina to put emphasis on prevention rather than treatment. This aligns with the growing demand to reduce the use of antibiotics or—whenever possible—replace them with alternative treatment options in farm animal medicine. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the last 20 years of uterine disease research and highlights promising new areas for future studies.",https://www.mdpi.com/2306-7381/11/2/66/pdf?version=1706860171,

Given cattle’s critical role in meeting human needs, effective management of this disease is essential to prevent significant losses. The study proposes a deep learning approach using the MobileNetV2 model and the RMSprop optimizer to address this challenge. Tests on a dataset of healthy and lumpy cattle images show an impressive accuracy of 95%, outperforming existing benchmarks by 4–10%. These results underline the potential of the proposed methodology to revolutionize the diagnosis and management of skin diseases in cattle farming.
