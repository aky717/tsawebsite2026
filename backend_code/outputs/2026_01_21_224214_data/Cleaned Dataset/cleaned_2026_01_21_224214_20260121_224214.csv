Often, such metabolites have antimicrobial, anticancer, antifungal, antiviral or other bio-activities and thus play an important role for applications in medicine and agriculture. In the past decade, genome mining has become a widely-used method to explore, access, and analyse the available biodiversity of these compounds. Since 2011, the ‘antibiotics and secondary metabolite analysis shell—antiSMASH’ (https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/) has supported researchers in their microbial genome mining tasks, both as a free to use web server and as a standalone tool under an OSI-approved open source licence. It is currently the most widely used tool for detecting and characterising biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in archaea, bacteria, and fungi. Here, we present the updated version 7 of antiSMASH. antiSMASH 7 increases the number of supported cluster types from 71 to 81, as well as containing improvements in the areas of chemical structure prediction, enzymatic assembly-line visualisation and gene cluster regulation.",https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/nar/gkad344/50195687/gkad344.pdf,

This review provides an overview of cellular and physiological mechanisms in plant responses to salt. We place cellular responses in a time- and tissue-dependent context in order to link them to observed phases in growth rate that occur in response to stress. Recent advances in phenotyping can now functionally or genetically link cellular signaling responses, ion transport, water management, and gene expression to growth, development, and survival. Halophytes, which are naturally salt-tolerant plants, are highlighted as success stories to learn from. We emphasize that (a) filling the major knowledge gaps in salt-induced signaling pathways, (b) increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of our knowledge of salt stress responses, (c) discovering and considering crop-specific responses, and (d) including halophytes in our comparative studies are all essential in order to take our approaches to increasing crop yields in saline soils to the next level.

In this Review, we discuss the current state of CRISPR-mediated genetic manipulation in human cells, animals, and plants along with relevant successes and challenges and present a roadmap for the future of this technology. Description A decade of CRISPR In the decade since the publication of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome-editing technology, the CRISPR toolbox and its applications have profoundly changed basic and applied biological research. Wang and Doudna now review the origins and utility of CRISPR-based genome editing, the successes and current limitations of the technology, and where innovation and engineering are needed. The authors describe important advances in the development of CRISPR genome-editing technology and make predictions about where the field is headed. They also highlight specific examples in medicine and agriculture that show how CRISPR is already affecting society, with exciting opportunities for the future. —DJ A review discusses the current state of CRISPR-mediated genetic manipulation in human cells, animals, and plants and considers its future potential. BACKGROUND The fields of molecular biology, genetics, and genomics are at a critical juncture—a moment in history when a convergence of knowledge and methods has made it both technically possible and incredibly useful to edit specific base pairs or segments of DNA in cells and living organisms. The advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) genome editing, coupled with advances in computing and imaging capabilities, has initiated a new era in which we can not only diagnose human diseases and even predict individual susceptibility based on personal genetics but also act on that information. Likewise, we can both identify and rapidly alter genes responsible for plant traits, transforming the pace of agricultural research and plant breeding. The applications of this technology convergence are profound and far reaching—and they are happening now. In the decade since the publication of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome editing technology, the CRISPR toolbox and its applications have profoundly changed biological research, impacting not only patients with genetic diseases but also agricultural practices and products. As a specific example from the field of genomic medicine, it has become feasible to obtain a complete sequence of the human genome in less than 24 hours—a staggering advance considering the first such sequence took 5 years to generate. Notably, designing and putting to use a potent CRISPR genome editor to obtain clinically actionable information from that genome—previously a near-intractable challenge—now takes only a matter of days. For additional background and related topics, we refer readers to in-depth reviews of the microbiology and structural biology of CRISPR systems and to articles about the considerable ethical and societal challenges of this technology. ADVANCES The past decade has witnessed the discovery, engineering, and deployment of RNA-programmed genome editors across many applications. By leveraging CRISPR-Cas9’s most fundamental activity to create a targeted genetic disruption in a gene or gene regulatory element, scientists have built successful platforms for the rapid creation of knockout mice and other animal models, genetic screening, and multiplexed editing. Beyond traditional CRISPR-Cas9–induced knockouts, base editing—a technology utilizing engineered Cas9’s fused to enzymes that alter the chemical nature of DNA bases—has also provided a highly useful strategy to generate site-specific and precise point mutations. Over the past decade, scientists have utilized CRISPR technology as a readily adaptable tool to probe biological function, dissect genetic interactions, and inform strategies to combat human diseases and engineer crops. This Review covers the origins and successes of CRISPR-based genome editing and discusses the most pressing challenges, which include improving editing accuracy and precision, implementing strategies for precise programmable genetic sequence insertions, improving targeted delivery of CRISPR editors, and increasing access and affordability. We examine current efforts addressing these challenges, including emerging gene insertion technologies and new delivery modalities, and describe where further innovation and engineering are needed. CRISPR genome editors are already being deployed in medicine and agriculture, and this Review highlights key examples, including a CRISPR-based therapy treating sickle cell disease, a more nutritious CRISPR-edited tomato, and a high-yield, disease-resistant CRISPR-edited wheat, to illustrate CRISPR’s current and potential future impacts in society. OUTLOOK In the decade ahead, genome editing research and applications will continue to expand and will intersect with advances in technologies, such as machine learning, live cell imaging, and sequencing. A combination of discovery and engineering will diversify and refine the CRISPR toolbox to combat current challenges and enable more wide-ranging applications in both fundamental and applied research. Just as during the advent of CRISPR genome editing, a combination of scientific curiosity and the desire to benefit society will drive the next decade of innovation in CRISPR technology. CRISPR: past, present, and future. The past decade of CRISPR technology has focused on building the platforms for generating gene knockouts, creating knockout mice and other animal models, genetic screening, and multiplexed editing. CRISPR’s applications in medicine and agriculture are already beginning and will serve as the focus for the next decade as society’s demands drive further innovation in CRISPR technology.",,

In addition, the spontaneous evolution, mutation of bacteria, and passing the resistant genes through horizontal gene transfer are significant contributors to antimicrobial resistance. Many studies have demonstrated the disastrous financial consequences of AMR including extremely high healthcare costs due to an increase in hospital admissions and drug usage. The literature review, which included articles published after the year 2012, was performed using Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar with the utilization of keyword searches. Results indicated that the multifactorial threat of antimicrobial resistance has resulted in different complex issues affecting countries across the globe.

Their large genomes are characterized by a high content of repetitive elements and large pericentromeric regions that are virtually devoid of meiotic recombination. Here we present a high-quality reference genome assembly for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). We use chromosome conformation capture mapping to derive the linear order of sequences across the pericentromeric space and to investigate the spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus at megabase resolution. The composition of genes and repetitive elements differs between distal and proximal regions. Gene family analyses reveal lineage-specific duplications of genes involved in the transport of nutrients to developing seeds and the mobilization of carbohydrates in grains. We demonstrate the importance of the barley reference sequence for breeding by inspecting the genomic partitioning of sequence variation in modern elite germplasm, highlighting regions vulnerable to genetic erosion. The International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium reports sequencing and assembly of a reference genome for barley, Hordeum vulgare. Triticeae grasses, which include barley, wheat and rye, are widely cultivated plants with particularly complex genomes and evolutionary histories. Sequencing of the barley genome has been particularly challenging owing to its large size and particular genomic features, such as an abundance of repetitive elements. Nils Stein and colleagues of the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium report sequencing and assembly of a reference genome for barley (Hordeumvulgare L). They use a combined approach of hierarchical shotgun sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosomes, genome mapping on nanochannel arrays and chromosome-scale scaffolding with Hi-C sequencing. This brings the first comprehensive, completely ordered assembly of the pericentromeric regions of a Triticeae genome.

The release of increasing amount of antibiotics into waters and soils creates a potential threat to all microorganisms in these environments. This review addresses issues related to the fate and degradation of antibiotics in soils and the impact of antibiotics on the structural, genetic and functional diversity of microbial communities. Due to the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, which is considered a worldwide public health problem, the abundance and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soils are also discussed. When antibiotic residues enter the soil, the main processes determining their persistence are sorption to organic particles and degradation/transformation. The wide range of DT50 values for antibiotic residues in soils shows that the processes governing persistence depend on a number of different factors, e.g., physico-chemical properties of the residue, characteristics of the soil, and climatic factors (temperature, rainfall, and humidity). The results presented in this review show that antibiotics affect soil microorganisms by changing their enzyme activity and ability to metabolize different carbon sources, as well as by altering the overall microbial biomass and the relative abundance of different groups (i.e., Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and fungi) in microbial communities. Studies using methods based on analyses of nucleic acids prove that antibiotics alter the biodiversity of microbial communities and the presence of many types of ARGs in soil are affected by agricultural and human activities. It is worth emphasizing that studies on ARGs in soil have resulted in the discovery of new genes and enzymes responsible for bacterial resistance to antibiotics. However, many ambiguous results indicate that precise estimation of the impact of antibiotics on the activity and diversity of soil microbial communities is a great challenge.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00338/pdf,

Therefore, many strategies have been used to produce abiotic stress tolerance crop plants, among them, abscisic acid (ABA) phytohormone engineering could be one of the methods of choice. ABA is an isoprenoid phytohormone, which regulates various physiological processes ranging from stomatal opening to protein storage and provides adaptation to many stresses like drought, salt, and cold stresses. ABA is also called an important messenger that acts as the signaling mediator for regulating the adaptive response of plants to different environmental stress conditions.

Among the latter, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) colonize roots of monocots and dicots, and enhance plant growth by direct and indirect mechanisms. Modification of root system architecture by PGPR implicates the production of phytohormones and other signals that lead, mostly, to enhanced lateral root branching and development of root hairs. PGPR also modify root functioning, improve plant nutrition and influence the physiology of the whole plant. Recent results provided first clues as to how PGPR signals could trigger these plant responses. Whether local and/or systemic, the plant molecular pathways involved remain often unknown. From an ecological point of view, it emerged that PGPR form coherent functional groups, whose rhizosphere ecology is influenced by a myriad of abiotic and biotic factors in natural and agricultural soils, and these factors can in turn modulate PGPR effects on roots. In this paper, we address novel knowledge and gaps on PGPR modes of action and signals, and highlight recent progress on the links between plant morphological and physiological effects induced by PGPR.

Using recent advances in sequencing, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium presents an annotated reference genome with a detailed analysis of gene content among subgenomes and the structural organization for all the chromosomes. Examples of quantitative trait mapping and CRISPR-based genome modification show the potential for using this genome in agricultural research and breeding. Ramírez-González et al. exploited the fruits of this endeavor to identify tissue-specific biased gene expression and coexpression networks during development and exposure to stress. These resources will accelerate our understanding of the genetic basis of bread wheat. Science, this issue p. eaar7191; see also p. eaar6089 Expression profiling of homoeologs (pairs of genes united by polyploidy) across tissues reveals expression asymmetry along wheat chromosomes. INTRODUCTION Polyploidy, arising from whole-genome duplication or interspecific hybridization, is ubiquitous across the plant and fungal kingdoms. The presence of highly related genes in polyploids, referred to as homoeologs, has been proposed to confer adaptive plasticity—for example, through neofunctionalization of duplicated genes or tissue-specific expression. This plasticity has facilitated the domestication and adaptation of major polyploid crops (e.g., wheat, cotton, and coffee). However, despite its likely importance, we have a limited understanding of the effect of polyploidy on gene expression and the extent to which homoeologs are similar or different in their expression patterns across development and tissues. RATIONALE Bread wheat is a polyploid derived from the hybridizations between three distinct diploid species and is an informative system for analyzing the effects of recent polyploidy on gene expression. Understanding the coordination of homoeologs and identifying the mechanisms associated with these processes should help define strategies to improve trait biology in a crop that provides more than 20% of the protein and caloric intake of humans. RESULTS Here we leverage 850 wheat RNA-sequencing samples, alongside the annotated genome, to determine the similarities and differences between homoeolog expression across a range of tissues, developmental stages, and cultivars. On average, ~30% of wheat homoeolog triads (composed of A, B, and D genome copies) showed nonbalanced expression patterns, with higher or lower expression from a single homoeolog with respect to the other two. These differences between homoeologs were associated with epigenetic changes affecting DNA methylation and histone modifications. Although nonbalanced homoeolog expression could be partially predicted by expression in diploid ancestors, large changes in relative homoeolog expression were observed owing to polyploidization. Our results suggest that the transposable elements in promoters relate more closely to the variation in the relative expression of homoeologs across tissues than to a ubiquitous effect across all tissues. We found that homoeologs with the highest inter-tissue variation had promoters with more frequent transposable element insertions and more varied cis-regulatory elements than homoeologs that were stable across tissues. We also identified expression asymmetry along wheat chromosomes. Homoeologs with the largest inter-tissue, inter-cultivar, and coding sequence variation were most often located in the highly recombinogenic distal ends of chromosomes. These transcriptionally dynamic homoeologs are under more relaxed selection pressure, potentially representing the first steps toward functional innovation through neo- or subfunctionalization. We generated tissue- and stress-specific coexpression networks that reveal extensive coordination of homoeolog expression throughout development. These networks, alongside detailed gene expression atlases (www.wheat-expression.com and http://bar.utoronto.ca), lay the groundwork to identify candidate genes influencing agronomic traits in wheat. CONCLUSION This study provides detailed insights into the transcriptional landscape of bread wheat, an evolutionarily young polyploid. Our work shows that homoeolog expression patterns in bread wheat have been shaped by polyploidy and are associated with both epigenetic modifications and variation in transposable elements within promoters of homoeologous genes. The extensive datasets and analyses presented here provide a framework that can help researchers and breeders develop strategies to improve crops by manipulating individual or multiple homoeologs to modulate trait responses. Homoeolog expression patterns in polyploid wheat. Seventy percent of triads (A, B, and D homoeologs) show balanced expression among homoeologs and are ubiquitously expressed (left), whereas ~30% show nonbalanced expression and are more tissue-specific (right; symbolized by three exemplar tissues). Variation in promoter elements and nonsynonymous substitution rates distinguish between individual triads with stable relative expression across tissues and triads with more inter-tissue variation (tissue-dynamic triads). The coordinated expression of highly related homoeologous genes in polyploid species underlies the phenotypes of many of the world’s major crops. Here we combine extensive gene expression datasets to produce a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of homoeolog expression patterns in hexaploid bread wheat. Bias in homoeolog expression varies between tissues, with ~30% of wheat homoeologs showing nonbalanced expression. We found expression asymmetries along wheat chromosomes, with homoeologs showing the largest inter-tissue, inter-cultivar, and coding sequence variation, most often located in high-recombination distal ends of chromosomes. These transcriptionally dynamic genes potentially represent the first steps toward neo- or subfunctionalization of wheat homoeologs. Coexpression networks reveal extensive coordination of homoeologs throughout development and, alongside a detailed expression atlas, provide a framework to target candidate genes underpinning agronomic traits in wheat.",https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6403/eaar6089.full.pdf,

Using resequencing of 60 wild individuals and 100 landraces from the genetically differentiated Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools, we confirmed 2 independent domestications from genetic pools that diverged before human colonization. Less than 10% of the 74 Mb of sequence putatively involved in domestication was shared by the two domestication events. We identified a set of genes linked with increased leaf and seed size and combined these results with quantitative trait locus data from Mesoamerican cultivars. Genes affected by domestication may be useful for genomics-enabled crop improvement.",https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3008.pdf,

ABA triggers a variety of physiological processes such as stomatal closure, root system modulation, organizing soil microbial communities, activation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression, and metabolic alterations. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of ABA-mediated drought responses in plants is critical for ensuring crop yield and global food security. In this review, we highlighted how plants adjust ABA perception, transcriptional levels of ABA- and drought-related genes, and regulation of metabolic pathways to alter drought stress responses at both cellular and the whole plant level.

Huang et al. reconstructed three biosynthetic networks from the small mustard plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Promiscuous acyltransferases and dehydrogenases contributed to metabolite diversification. The plant may use these specialized metabolites to modulate the microbiota surrounding its roots. Disruption of the pathways and intervention with purified compounds caused changes in the root microbiota. Science, this issue p. eaau6389 A widely studied model plant produces a range of metabolites that regulate the microbial community around its roots. INTRODUCTION Specialized metabolism is a feature of plant evolution and adaption. Plant-specialized metabolites have ecological functions, mediating interactions between plants and their environments. Although microbes can have diverse effects on plant growth and fitness, how plants assemble and modulate their microbiota remains unclear. Understanding the factors and mechanisms underlying this process will open up avenues for engineering plant microbiota for sustainable agriculture. Plants are estimated to use ~20% of their photosynthesized carbon to make root-derived organic molecules. However, whether (and if so, which) specialized metabolites can direct the assembly of specific root microbiota is not known. RATIONALE Triterpenes are plant-specialized metabolites that have functions in plant defense and signaling and also have antimicrobial activities. They are one of the largest and most structurally diverse families of plant natural products. The genome of the small mustard plant Arabidopsis thaliana harbors four root-expressed triterpene biosynthetic gene clusters that encode unknown triterpene biosynthetic pathways. Plant biosynthetic gene clustering is likely to be a result of strong selection pressure during evolution with associated production of small molecules of biological and ecological importance. Several of these clustered Arabidopsis genes have been implicated in defense against root pathogens, further suggesting that metabolites derived from these triterpene biosynthetic gene clusters may modulate the Arabidopsis root microbiota. RESULTS We have elucidated a specialized metabolic network expressed in the roots of A. thaliana that consists of functionally divergent triterpene biosynthetic gene clusters connected by scattered genes outside the clusters that encode promiscuous acyltransferases and alcohol dehydrogenases. This metabolic network has a latent capacity for synthesizing more than 50 previously unknown root metabolites. This is a relatively large number considering the total number of nonvolatile root metabolites that we detected (approximately 300). We characterized three divergent pathways for the biosynthesis of root triterpene metabolites: thalianin, thalianyl fatty acid esters, and arabidin. Analysis of the root microbiota of A. thaliana mutants disrupted in the biosynthesis of these compounds revealed shifts in the composition and diversity of their root microbiota compared with those of the wild type. Comparison with the root bacterial profiles of the taxonomically remote species rice and wheat supports a role for this specialized triterpene biosynthetic network in mediating the establishment of an Arabidopsis-specific microbiota. We next tested the activity of purified or synthesized Arabidopsis root triterpenes and representative triterpene cocktails in vitro toward 19 taxonomically diverse bacterial strains isolated from the A. thaliana root microbiota. We found that these compounds could indeed selectively modulate the growth of these bacteria, examples of both positive and negative modulation being evident. The modulation effects of the various triterpenes on the growth of different bacterial strains correlated with the relative differential abundance of the differential bacterial genera in the roots of A. thaliana Col-0 and triterpene mutant lines. Moreover, some root bacteria were found to be able to selectively metabolize certain triterpenes (such as thalianyl fatty acid esters) and use the breakdown products such as palmitic acid as carbon sources for proliferation. CONCLUSION We demonstrate that A. thaliana produces a range of specialized triterpenes that direct the assembly and maintenance of an A. thaliana–specific microbiota, enabling it to shape and tailor the microbial community within and around its roots to its own purposes. We speculate that metabolic diversification within the plant kingdom may provide a basis for communication and recognition that enables the sculpting of microbiota tailored to the needs of the host and that this may in part explain the existence of plant-specialized metabolism. Our study opens up opportunities for engineering root microbiota and further paves the way for investigating the functions of root microbiota in plant growth and health. Dynamic modulation of the Arabidopsis root microbiota by specialized triterpene metabolites derived from biosynthetic gene clusters. The specialized triterpenes thalianin, thalianyl fatty acid esters, and arabidin selectively modulate A. thaliana root microbiota members by promoting (indicated with the orange and purple bacteria) or inhibiting (indicated with the blue bacteria) the growth of different bacterial taxa and, in some cases, by serving as carbon sources (purple bacteria). These triterpenes are products of pathways encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters and nonclustered genes. Colored arrows indicate genes encoding different types of enzymes: black, triterpene synthase; red, cytochrome P450s; purple, acyltransferases; and blue, alcohol dehydrogenases. The dynamic modulation of root bacteria mediated by these specialized triterpenes contributes to the assembly of an A. thaliana–specific root microbiota. Plant specialized metabolites have ecological functions, yet the presence of numerous uncharacterized biosynthetic genes in plant genomes suggests that many molecules remain unknown. We discovered a triterpene biosynthetic network in the roots of the small mustard plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Collectively, we have elucidated and reconstituted three divergent pathways for the biosynthesis of root triterpenes, namely thalianin (seven steps), thalianyl medium-chain fatty acid esters (three steps), and arabidin (five steps). A. thaliana mutants disrupted in the biosynthesis of these compounds have altered root microbiota. In vitro bioassays with purified compounds reveal selective growth modulation activities of pathway metabolites toward root microbiota members and their biochemical transformation and utilization by bacteria, supporting a role for this biosynthetic network in shaping an Arabidopsis-specific root microbial community.",https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/files/200179256/Huang_et_al_Science_2019.pdf,

Despite the apparent overlap between soil and clinical resistomes, factors influencing ARG composition in soil and their movement between genomes and habitats remain largely unknown. General metagenome functions often correlate with the underlying structure of bacterial communities. However, ARGs are proposed to be highly mobile, prompting speculation that resistomes may not correlate with phylogenetic signatures or ecological divisions. To investigate these relationships, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 18 antibiotics from 18 agricultural and grassland soils. The 2,895 ARGs we discovered were mostly new, and represent all major resistance mechanisms. We demonstrate that distinct soil types harbour distinct resistomes, and that the addition of nitrogen fertilizer strongly influenced soil ARG content. Resistome composition also correlated with microbial phylogenetic and taxonomic structure, both across and within soil types. Consistent with this strong correlation, mobility elements (genes responsible for horizontal gene transfer between bacteria such as transposases and integrases) syntenic with ARGs were rare in soil by comparison with sequenced pathogens, suggesting that ARGs may not transfer between soil bacteria as readily as is observed between human pathogens. Together, our results indicate that bacterial community composition is the primary determinant of soil ARG content, challenging previous hypotheses that horizontal gene transfer effectively decouples resistomes from phylogeny.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4079543,

From the assembly of the genome of Thinopyrum elongatum, a wild relative of wheat used in breeding programs to improve cultivated wheat, Wang et al. cloned a gene that can address both problems (see the Perspective by Wulff and Jones). The encoded glutathione S-transferase detoxifies the trichothecene toxin and, when expressed in wheat, confers resistance to FHB. Science, this issue p. eaba5435; see also p. 822 A wild relative of cultivated wheat offers a gene that drives resistance to an agricultural headache. INTRODUCTION Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a fungal disease that devastates global wheat production, with losses of billions of dollars annually. Unlike foliar diseases, FHB occurs directly on wheat spikes (inflorescences). The infection lowers grain yield and also causes the grain to be contaminated by mycotoxins produced by the Fusarium pathogen, thus imposing health threats to humans and livestock. Although plant breeders have improved wheat resistance to FHB, the lack of wheat strains with stable FHB resistance has limited progress. RATIONALE Many genetic loci in wheat affect FHB resistance but most only have minor effects; only a few exhibit a stable major effect on resistance. Wheat relatives in the Triticeae tribe carry resistant genes to different diseases including FHB and thus can be alternative sources of FHB resistance for wheat breeding. Thinopyrum wheatgrass has been used as a source of beneficial genes transferable to wheat by distant hybridization breeding since the 1930s. Fhb7, a gene transferred from Thinopyrum to wheat, showed a stable large effect on FHB resistance. However, the lack of a Thinopyrum reference genome hampered gene cloning and marker development, delaying the use of Fhb7 in wheat breeding. Here, we cloned Fhb7 using a reference assembly that we generated for Th. elongatum and characterized its resistance mechanisms and evolutionary history. RESULTS Using sequence data from Th. elongatum, we assembled the Triticeae E reference genome with 44,474 high-confidence genes annotated. Using this reference, we genetically mapped Fhb7 and located it to a 245-kb genomic region. We determined a gene encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) as Fhb7 by virus-induced gene silencing and evaluated mutants and transgenic plants. We discovered that Fhb7 detoxifies pathogen-produced trichothecene toxins by conjugating a glutathione (GSH) unit onto the epoxide moieties of type A and B trichothecenes. Fhb7 GST homologs are absent in the plant kingdom, but one sequence showing ~97% identity with Fhb7 was found in endophytic fungi of an Epichloë species that establishes symbiosis with temperate grasses. This result suggests that Fhb7 might have been transferred from Epichloë to Th. elongatum through horizontal gene transfer. Finally, we demonstrated that Fhb7, when introgressed into diverse wheat backgrounds by distant hybridization, confers broad resistance to both FHB and crown rot without penalizing wheat yield. Our results suggest a source of Fusarium resistance for wheat improvement. CONCLUSION Th. elongatum carries biotic and abiotic resistance genes and is a useful resource for wheat breeding. The assembled Th. elongatum reference genome can aid identification and cloning of such genes for wheat improvement. Cloning of Fhb7 revealed that it encodes a GST that can detoxify trichothecene toxins. Thus, Fhb7 resistance differs from Fhb1 resistance, which depends on a reduction of pathogen growth in spikes, although both confer durable resistance. The ability of Fhb7 to detoxify multiple mycotoxins produced by various Fusarium species demonstrates its potential as a source of resistance to the various diseases for which Fusarium trichothecenes are virulence factors. The deployment of Fhb7 in commercial wheat cultivars could alleviate both the food safety issue for consumers and the yield loss problem for growers. Sequence homologies between fungal and plant Fhb7 suggested that horizontal gene transfer may help to shape plant genomes. Fhb7 confers FHB resistance by detoxifying trichothecenes. (A) Fhb7 in Th. elongatum genome likely came from an Epichloë fungus through horizontal gene transfer. Fhb7 drives FHB resistance when introgressed from Thinopyrum into wheat. (B) Fhb7 encodes a GST that detoxifies Fusarium-produced trichothecenes by conjugating GSH (blue) to the epoxy group (red). R1 to R5 refer to the variable groups in trichothecenes. Fusarium head blight (FHB), a fungal disease caused by Fusarium species that produce food toxins, currently devastates wheat production worldwide, yet few resistance resources have been discovered in wheat germplasm. Here, we cloned the FHB resistance gene Fhb7 by assembling the genome of Thinopyrum elongatum, a species used in wheat distant hybridization breeding. Fhb7 encodes a glutathione S-transferase (GST) and confers broad resistance to Fusarium species by detoxifying trichothecenes through de-epoxidation. Fhb7 GST homologs are absent in plants, and our evidence supports that Th. elongatum has gained Fhb7 through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from an endophytic Epichloë species. Fhb7 introgressions in wheat confers resistance to both FHB and crown rot in diverse wheat backgrounds without yield penalty, providing a solution for Fusarium resistance breeding.",,

Sucrose synthase (SuSy) is a glycosyl transferase enzyme that plays a key role in sugar metabolism, primarily in sink tissues. SuSy catalyzes the reversible cleavage of sucrose into fructose and either uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-G) or adenosine diphosphate glucose (ADP-G). The products of sucrose cleavage by SuSy are available for many metabolic pathways, such as energy production, primary-metabolite production, and the synthesis of complex carbohydrates. SuSy proteins are usually homotetramers with an average monomeric molecular weight of about 90 kD (about 800 amino acids long). Plant SuSy isozymes are mainly located in the cytosol or adjacent to plasma membrane, but some SuSy proteins are found in the cell wall, vacuoles, and mitochondria. Plant SUS gene families are usually small, containing between four to seven genes, with distinct exon-intron structures. Plant SUS genes are divided into three separate clades, which are present in both monocots and dicots. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis indicates that a first SUS duplication event may have occurred before the divergence of the gymnosperms and angiosperms and a second duplication event probably occurred in a common angiosperm ancestor, leading to the existence of all three clades in both monocots and dicots. Plants with reduced SuSy activity have been shown to have reduced growth, reduced starch, cellulose or callose synthesis, reduced tolerance to anaerobic-stress conditions and altered shoot apical meristem function and leaf morphology. Plants overexpressing SUS have shown increased growth, increased xylem area and xylem cell-wall width, and increased cellulose and starch contents, making SUS high-potential candidate genes for the improvement of agricultural traits in crop plants.

Through genome association analysis of sorghum, a naturally high-alkaline–tolerant crop, we detected a major locus, Alkaline Tolerance 1 (AT1), specifically related to alkaline-salinity sensitivity. An at1 allele with a carboxyl-terminal truncation increased sensitivity, whereas knockout of AT1 increased tolerance to alkalinity in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize. AT1 encodes an atypical G protein γ subunit that affects the phosphorylation of aquaporins to modulate the distribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These processes appear to protect plants against oxidative stress by alkali. Designing knockouts of AT1 homologs or selecting its natural nonfunctional alleles could improve crop productivity in sodic lands. Description Growth on alkaline soils Alkaline soils limit the ability of plants to take in nutrients and manage salt stress. Zhang et al. have now identified a locus in sorghum that determines sensitivity to salty alkaline soils. The Alkali Tolerance 1 (AT1) locus encodes a guanine nucleotide–binding protein gamma subunit that regulates the phosphorylation of aquaporins, channels that can transport hydrogen peroxide to alleviate oxidative stress. Crops that could better manage growth on alkaline soils could open up agriculture to the millions of hectares of alkaline soils. —PJH Regulation of phosphorylation on aquaporin underlies the ability of sorghum to tolerate alkaline soils. INTRODUCTION According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there are currently >1 billion ha of land affected by salt. Among these, ~60% are classified as sodic soil areas. These have high pH and are dominated by sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The effects of global warming and a lack of fresh water will lead to >50% of arable land becoming affected by salt by 2050, thus severely affecting the world’s food security. Identifying and/or engineering sodic-tolerant crops is imperative to solve this challenge. Although salinity tolerance has been studied extensively, alkalinity tolerance in plants has not been studied in depth. RATIONALE Sorghum originates from Africa, where it can grow in harsh environments. As a result, sorghum has evolved greater tolerance to adapt to multiple abiotic stresses compared with other crops. Some sorghum varieties can survive in sodic soil with a pH as high as 10.0. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis was performed with a large sorghum association panel consisting of 352 representative sorghum accessions. We detected a major locus, Alkaline tolerance 1 (AT1), linked to alkaline tolerance. We found that AT1, encoding an atypical G protein γ subunit (a homolog to rice GS3), contributes to alkaline sensitivity by modulating the efflux of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under environmental stress. RESULTS On the basis of the results of the GWAS analysis, we sequenced the cDNA regions of SbAT1 (Sorghum bicolor AT1) in 37 sorghum accessions with different degrees of alkaline sensitivity. Two typical haplotypes (Hap1 and Hap2) of SbAT1 were identified according to the five leading variant sites associated with sorghum alkali sensitivity. Hap1 encodes an intact SbAT1. A frame shift mutation (from “G” to “GGTGGC”) within Hap2 results in a premature stop codon probably encoding a truncated protein with only 136 amino acids at the N terminus (named Sbat1). To confirm the function of the AT1 locus, we generated a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) with two AT1 haplotypes to assess the allelic effect of AT1 on sorghum tolerance to alkali. We found that the Sbat1 allele (Hap2), encoding a truncated form of SbAT1, increased plant alkaline sensitivity compared with wild-type full-length SbAT1 (Hap1). Overexpression of AT1/GS3 reduced alkaline tolerance in sorghum and rice, and overexpression of the C-terminal truncated AT1/GS3 showed a more severe alkaline sensitive response. This was confirmed in millet and rice, which suggests that AT1/GS3 functions negatively in plant alkali tolerance. By contrast, knockout (ko) of AT1/GS3 increased tolerance to alkaline stress in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize, which indicates a conserved pathway in monocot crops. By immunoprecipitation in combination with mass spectrometry (IP-MS), we found that AT1/GS3 interacts with aquaporin PIP2s that are involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Genetic analysis showed that OsPIP2;1ko/2;2ko had lower alkaline tolerance than their wild-type control. The redox probe Cyto-roGFP2-Orp1 sensing H2O2 in the cytoplasm was applied. The results showed that, upon alkaline treatment, the relative H2O2 level increased in OsPIP2;1ko/2;2ko compared with wild-type plants. These results suggested that the phosphorylation of aquaporins could modulate the efflux of H2O2. Gγ negatively regulates the phosphorylation of PIP2;1, leading to elevated ROS levels in plants under alkaline stress. To assess the application of the AT1/GS3 gene for crop production, field tests were carried out. We found that the nonfunctional mutant, either obtained from natural varieties or generated by gene editing in several monocots, including sorghum, millet, rice, and maize, can improve the field performance of crops in terms of biomass or grain production when cultivated on sodic lands. CONCLUSION We concluded that SbAT1 encodes an atypical G protein γ subunit and inhibits the phosphorylation of aquaporins that may be used as H2O2 exporters under alkaline stress. With this knowledge, genetically engineered crops with knockouts of AT1 homologs or use of natural nonfunctional alleles could greatly improve crop yield in sodic lands. This may contribute to maximizing the use of global sodic lands to ensure food security. Genetic modification of AT1 enhances alkaline stress tolerance. The Gγ subunit, AT1, pairs with Gβ to negatively modulate the phosphorylation level of PIP2 aquaporins. Thus, AT1 reduces the H2O2 export activity of PIP2s, leading to the overaccumulation of H2O2 and resulting in alkaline stress sensitivity. By contrast, the artificial or natural knockouts of AT1 homologs release the inhibition of PIP2s by AT1 in crops and have improved survival rates and yield under alkaline stress.

Agricultural scientists realized that PGD can be captured and stored in the form of plant genetic resources (PGR) such as gene bank, DNA library, and so forth, in the biorepository which preserve genetic material for long period. However, conserved PGR must be utilized for crop improvement in order to meet future global challenges in relation to food and nutritional security. This paper comprehensively reviews four important areas; (i) the significance of plant genetic diversity (PGD) and PGR especially on agriculturally important crops (mostly field crops); (ii) risk associated with narrowing the genetic base of current commercial cultivars and climate change; (iii) analysis of existing PGD analytical methods in pregenomic and genomic era; and (iv) modern tools available for PGD analysis in postgenomic era. This discussion benefits the plant scientist community in order to use the new methods and technology for better and rapid assessment, for utilization of germplasm from gene banks to their applied breeding programs. With the advent of new biotechnological techniques, this process of genetic manipulation is now being accelerated and carried out with more precision (neglecting environmental effects) and fast-track manner than the classical breeding techniques. It is also to note that gene banks look into several issues in order to improve levels of germplasm distribution and its utilization, duplication of plant identity, and access to database, for prebreeding activities. Since plant breeding research and cultivar development are integral components of improving food production, therefore, availability of and access to diverse genetic sources will ensure that the global food production network becomes more sustainable.

Photorespiration deals with these by-products, converting them into metabolically useful components, but at the cost of energy lost. South et al. constructed a metabolic pathway in transgenic tobacco plants that more efficiently recaptures the unproductive by-products of photosynthesis with less energy lost (see the Perspective by Eisenhut and Weber). In field trials, these transgenic tobacco plants were ∼40% more productive than wild-type tobacco plants. Science, this issue p. eaat9077; see also p. 32 Tobacco plants carrying engineered glycolate metabolic pathways showed as much as 40% greater productivity than wild-type plants in field trials. INTRODUCTION Meeting food demands for the growing global human population requires improving crop productivity, and large gains are possible through enhancing photosynthetic efficiency. Photosynthesis requires the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), but photorespiration occurs in most plants such as soybean, rice, and wheat (known as C3 crops) when RuBisCO oxygenates RuBP instead, requiring costly processing of toxic byproducts such as glycolate. Photorespiration can reduce C3 crop photosynthetic efficiency by 20 to 50%. Although various strategies exist for lowering the costs of photorespiration, chamber- and greenhouse-grown plants with altered photorespiratory pathways within the chloroplast have shown promising results, including increased photosynthetic rates and plant size. RATIONALE To determine if alternative photorespiratory pathways could effectively improve C3 field crop productivity, we tested the performance of three alternative photorespiratory pathways in field-grown tobacco. One pathway used five genes from the Escherichia coli glycolate oxidation pathway; a second pathway used glycolate oxidase and malate synthase from plants and catalase from E. coli; and the third pathway used plant malate synthase and a green algal glycolate dehydrogenase. All enzymes in the alternative pathway designs were directed to the chloroplast. RNA interference (RNAi) was also used to down-regulate a native chloroplast glycolate transporter in the photorespiratory pathway, thereby limiting metabolite flux through the native pathway. The three pathways were introduced with and without the transporter RNAi construct into tobacco, which is an ideal model field crop because it is easily transformed, has a short life cycle, produces large quantities of seed, and develops a robust canopy similar to that of other field crops. RESULTS Using a synthetic biology approach to vary promoter gene combinations, we generated a total of 17 construct designs of the three pathways with and without the transporter RNAi construct. Initial screens for photoprotection by alternative pathway function under high–photorespiratory stress conditions identified three to five independent transformants of each design for further analysis. Gene and protein expression analyses confirmed expression of the introduced genes and suppression of the native transporter in RNAi plants. In greenhouse screens, pathway 1 increased biomass by nearly 13%. Pathway 2 showed no benefit compared to wild type. Introduction of pathway 3 increased biomass by 18% without RNAi and 24% with RNAi, which were consistent with changes in photorespiratory metabolism and higher photosynthetic rates. Ultimately, field testing across two different growing seasons showed significant increases in biomass of pathway 3 plants with RNAi compared to WT of 20% in 2016 (P =0.04) and by 24% in 2017 (P = 0.018). In addition, this pathway increased the light-use efficiency of photosynthesis by 17% in the field. CONCLUSION Engineering more efficient photorespiratory pathways into tobacco while inhibiting the native pathway markedly increased both photosynthetic efficiency and vegetative biomass. We are optimistic that similar gains may be achieved and translated into increased yield in C3 grain crops because photorespiration is common to all C3 plants and higher photosynthetic rates under elevated CO2, which suppresses photorespiration and increases harvestable yield in C3 crops. Alternative photorespiratory pathways in tobacco. Three alternative pathways [1 (red), 2 (dark blue), and 3(light blue)] introduced into tobacco chloroplasts for more efficient recycling of glycolate. RNAi suppresses the native glycolate/glycerate transporter PLGG1 to prevent glycolate from leaving the chloroplast and entering the native pathway (gray). Photorespiration is required in C3 plants to metabolize toxic glycolate formed when ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase oxygenates rather than carboxylates ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Depending on growing temperatures, photorespiration can reduce yields by 20 to 50% in C3 crops. Inspired by earlier work, we installed into tobacco chloroplasts synthetic glycolate metabolic pathways that are thought to be more efficient than the native pathway. Flux through the synthetic pathways was maximized by inhibiting glycolate export from the chloroplast. The synthetic pathways tested improved photosynthetic quantum yield by 20%. Numerous homozygous transgenic lines increased biomass productivity between 19 and 37% in replicated field trials. These results show that engineering alternative glycolate metabolic pathways into crop chloroplasts while inhibiting glycolate export into the native pathway can drive increases in C3 crop yield under agricultural field conditions.",https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/363/6422/eaat9077.full.pdf,

Drought stress is one of the consequences of climate change that has a negative impact on crop growth and yield. In the past, many simulation models were proposed to predict climate change and drought occurrences, and it is extremely important to improve essential crops to meet the challenges of drought stress which limits crop productivity and production. Wheat and barley are among the most common and widely used crops due to their economic and social values. Many parts of the world depend on these two crops for food and feed, and both crops are vulnerable to drought stress. Improving drought stress tolerance is a very challenging task for wheat and barley researchers and more research is needed to better understand this stress. The progress made in understanding drought tolerance is due to advances in three main research areas: physiology, breeding, and genetic research. The physiology research focused on the physiological and biochemical metabolic pathways that plants use when exposed to drought stress. New wheat and barley genotypes having a high degree of drought tolerance are produced through breeding by making crosses from promising drought-tolerant genotypes and selecting among their progeny. Also, identifying genes contributing to drought tolerance is very important. Previous studies showed that drought tolerance is a polygenic trait and genetic constitution will help to dissect the gene network(s) controlling drought tolerance. This review explores the recent advances in these three research areas to improve drought tolerance in wheat and barley.",https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/13/3137/pdf?version=1561627108,
