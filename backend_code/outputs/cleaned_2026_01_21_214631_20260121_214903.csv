Most AD cases are sporadic where age represents the greatest risk factor. Lack of understanding of the disease mechanism hinders the development of efficacious therapeutic approaches. The loss of synapses in the affected brain regions correlates best with cognitive impairment in AD patients and has been considered as the early mechanism that precedes neuronal loss. Oxidative stress has been recognized as a contributing factor in aging and in the progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with age- and disease-dependent loss of mitochondrial function, altered metal homeostasis, and reduced antioxidant defense directly affect synaptic activity and neurotransmission in neurons leading to cognitive dysfunction. In addition, molecular targets affected by ROS include nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, lipids, proteins, calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics and function, cellular architecture, receptor trafficking and endocytosis, and energy homeostasis. Abnormal cellular metabolism in turn could affect the production and accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, which independently could exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production, thereby contributing to a vicious cycle. While mounting evidence implicates ROS in the AD etiology, clinical trials with antioxidant therapies have not produced consistent results. In this review, we will discuss the role of oxidative stress in synaptic dysfunction in AD, innovative therapeutic strategies evolved based on a better understanding of the complexity of molecular mechanisms of AD, and the dual role ROS play in health and disease.",https://content.iospress.com:443/download/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad161088?id=journal-of-alzheimers-disease%2Fjad161088,

Here we show that microglia are also critical modulators of neuronal activity and associated behavioural responses in mice. Microglia respond to neuronal activation by suppressing neuronal activity, and ablation of microglia amplifies and synchronizes the activity of neurons, leading to seizures. Suppression of neuronal activation by microglia occurs in a highly region-specific fashion and depends on the ability of microglia to sense and catabolize extracellular ATP, which is released upon neuronal activation by neurons and astrocytes. ATP triggers the recruitment of microglial protrusions and is converted by the microglial ATP/ADP hydrolysing ectoenzyme CD39 into AMP; AMP is then converted into adenosine by CD73, which is expressed on microglia as well as other brain cells. Microglial sensing of ATP, the ensuing microglia-dependent production of adenosine, and the adenosine-mediated suppression of neuronal responses via the adenosine receptor A 1 R are essential for the regulation of neuronal activity and animal behaviour. Our findings suggest that this microglia-driven negative feedback mechanism operates similarly to inhibitory neurons and is essential for protecting the brain from excessive activation in health and disease. Microglia, the brain’s immune cells, suppress neuronal activity in response to synaptic ATP release and alter behavioural responses in mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7577179,

Alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiome play an active role in the aetiology of neurological disorders. Here, we dissect the amyloidogenic properties of biofilm-associated proteins (BAPs) of the gut microbiota and their implications for synucleinopathies. We demonstrate that BAPs are naturally assembled as amyloid-like fibrils in insoluble fractions isolated from the human gut microbiota. We show that BAP genes are part of the accessory genomes, revealing microbiome variability. Remarkably, the abundance of certain BAP genes in the gut microbiome is correlated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) incidence. Using cultured dopaminergic neurons and Caenorhabditis elegans models, we report that BAP-derived amyloids induce α-synuclein aggregation. Our results show that the chaperone-mediated autophagy is compromised by BAP amyloids. Indeed, inoculation of BAP fibrils into the brains of wild-type mice promote key pathological features of PD. Therefore, our findings establish the use of BAP amyloids as potential targets and biomarkers of α-synucleinopathies.

Here, we report astrocyte molecular profiles, diversity, and morphology across the mouse central nervous system (CNS). We identified shared and region-specific astrocytic genes and functions and explored the cellular origins of their regional diversity. We identified gene networks correlated with astrocyte morphology, several of which unexpectedly contained Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk genes. CRISPR/Cas9–mediated reduction of candidate genes reduced astrocyte morphological complexity and resulted in cognitive deficits. The same genes were down-regulated in human AD, in an AD mouse model that displayed reduced astrocyte morphology, and in other human brain disorders. We thus provide comprehensive molecular data on astrocyte diversity and mechanisms across the CNS and on the molecular basis of astrocyte morphology in health and disease. Description Astrocyte diversity and morphology Astrocytes are the major type of glia, displaying complex bushy morphologies as their defining feature. Endo et al. studied astrocyte similarities, diversity, and morphology across the mouse central nervous system (CNS) (see the Perspective by Baldwin). They identified gene networks related to astrocyte morphology between CNS regions, several of which unexpectedly included genes related to risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). When expression of these genes was reduced in mice, astrocyte morphological complexity was diminished, and mice exhibited impairments in a cognitive test. Remarkably, the same genes are down-regulated in both a mouse model of AD and in human AD and several other CNS disorders. These findings suggest that loss of astrocyte morphology may be therapeutically targetable in diverse CNS disorders. —SMH The molecular basis of astrocyte diversity and of their complex morphology in health and disease states is elucidated. INTRODUCTION The central nervous system (CNS) comprises a large population of non-neuronal cells called glia. The predominant type of glia are astrocytes, which were discovered ~140 years ago. Astrocytes tile the entire CNS, serve critical homeostatic functions, and display complex, “bushy” morphologies—their defining feature. Unlike CNS neurons, which are highly diverse, astrocytes have historically been considered largely homogenous, serving as a type of omnipresent glue that is equivalent between CNS areas. Although recent studies have challenged this belief, there has been no broad assessment of astrocyte diversity, similarity, or morphology across the CNS of any species. An important goal, therefore, is to rigorously understand the molecular similarities and differences between astrocytes in the CNS, to determine how they affect astrocyte morphology, and to determine how these properties relate to normal and disease conditions. RATIONALE It is critical to understand all cell types of the CNS in detail as part of our quest to explore fundamental biology and to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat CNS disorders. We studied astrocyte regional diversity and major signaling pathways using whole-brain imaging, astrocyte-neuron density, marker expression, astrocyte-specific and bulk tissue gene expression, single-cell gene expression, astrocyte morphology, and interrelationships between gene expression and morphology using bioinformatic methods across the CNS. The data were mined to identify genes and pathways related to astrocyte morphological complexity, which we explored experimentally using gene knockdowns. We then compared these morphology-related genes with astrocytic differentially expressed genes from an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse model displaying reduced astrocyte morphology, as well as in relation to gene expression in AD and other CNS disorders. RESULTS We found several hundred genes that were enriched within and shared among astrocytes in the CNS, with functions related to metabolism, cholesterol, and neurotransmitter uptake and biosynthesis. These genes represent the core functions of astrocytes, but little is known about approximately a third of them, implying that understanding the fundamental physiology of astrocytes across CNS areas is an important ongoing experimental goal. Our data also reveal that astrocytes have molecular features and functions specific to CNS regions, and that these region-specific functions arise from the local tissue environment and by variable representation of seven distinct astrocyte subclusters. We mined our data to identify gene networks related to astrocyte morphology, and unexpectedly discovered several AD risk genes. We developed astrocyte-specific CRISPR/Cas9–based gene knockdown to reduce the expression of such genes in the hippocampus. We found a reduction of astrocyte morphology with changes in a cognitive task after knockdown of key morphology-related genes, indicating that astrocyte morphological changes affect neural circuit function. In addition to AD risk genes that were astrocyte morphology related, we found a significant association between morphology-related genes and those related to several other common CNS disorders. CONCLUSION We provide comprehensive molecular data that will allow many new types of experiments to explore core features of astrocytes across the CNS, in particular, those unique to specific regions and how they relate to the dynamics and biophysics of neural circuits in specific CNS regions. We used our data to identify the molecular underpinnings of astrocyte morphology between CNS regions and to show that reduced astrocyte morphological complexity, and the attendant loss of tissue support, is common to diverse CNS disorders. This raises the prospect that restoring astrocyte morphology, and thus the ensuing neuronal and tissue support functions, may be therapeutically beneficial in disease. Our findings provide the molecular basis to explore such strategies and to unravel the nascent underlying biology determining how astrocytes contribute to CNS function and dysfunction.

(2) Gene expression data revealed the molecular signatures of astrocyte diversity and its origins. (3) Gene expression and morphological data identified gene networks related to complex morphology.

The present review describes the physiological and pathophysiological properties of tau and how these relate to its distribution and functions in neurons. We highlight the post-translational modifications of tau, which are pivotal in defining and modulating tau localisation and its roles in health and disease. We include discussion of other pathologically relevant changes in tau, including mutation and aggregation, and how these aspects impinge on the propensity of tau to propagate, and potentially drive neuronal loss, in diseased brain. Finally, we describe the cascade of pathological events that may be driven by tau dysfunction, including impaired axonal transport, alterations in synapse and mitochondrial function, activation of the unfolded protein response and defective protein degradation. It is important to fully understand the range of neuronal functions attributed to tau, since this will provide vital information on its involvement in the development and pathogenesis of disease.

Clinically, CIPN is a mostly sensory neuropathy that may be accompanied by motor and autonomic changes of varying intensity and duration. Due to its high prevalence among cancer patients, CIPN constitutes a major problem for both cancer patients and survivors as well as for their health care providers, especially because, at the moment, there is no single effective method of preventing CIPN; moreover, the possibilities of treating this syndrome are very limited. There are six main substance groups that cause damage to peripheral sensory, motor and autonomic neurons, which result in the development of CIPN: platinum-based antineoplastic agents, vinca alkaloids, epothilones (ixabepilone), taxanes, proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib) and immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide). Among them, the most neurotoxic are platinum-based agents, taxanes, ixabepilone and thalidomide; other less neurotoxic but also commonly used drugs are bortezomib and vinca alkaloids.

In the past decade, there has been considerable progress in understanding not only the molecular pathways involved in BBB development, but also BBB breakdown in neurological diseases. Specifically, the Wnt/β-catenin, retinoic acid and sonic hedgehog pathways moved into the focus of BBB research. Moreover, angiopoietin/Tie2 signalling that is linked to angiogenic processes has gained attention in the BBB field. Blood vessels play an essential role in initiation and progression of many diseases, including inflammation outside the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, the potential influence of CNS blood vessels in neurological diseases associated with BBB alterations or neuroinflammation has become a major focus of current research to understand their contribution to pathogenesis. Moreover, the BBB remains a major obstacle to pharmaceutical intervention in the CNS. The complications may either be expressed by inadequate therapeutic delivery like in brain tumours, or by poor delivery of the drug across the BBB and ineffective bioavailability. In this review, we initially describe the cellular and molecular components that contribute to the steady state of the healthy BBB. We then discuss BBB alterations in ischaemic stroke, primary and metastatic brain tumour, chronic inflammation and Alzheimer’s disease. Throughout the review, we highlight common mechanisms of BBB abnormalities among these diseases, in particular the contribution of neuroinflammation to BBB dysfunction and disease progression, and emphasise unique aspects of BBB alteration in certain diseases such as brain tumours. Moreover, this review highlights novel strategies to monitor BBB function by non-invasive imaging techniques focussing on ischaemic stroke, as well as novel ways to modulate BBB permeability and function to promote treatment of brain tumours, inflammation and Alzheimer’s disease. In conclusion, a deep understanding of signals that maintain the healthy BBB and promote fluctuations in BBB permeability in disease states will be key to elucidate disease mechanisms and to identify potential targets for diagnostics and therapeutic modulation of the BBB.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00401-018-1815-1.pdf,

Indeed, imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory somatosensory signalling, alterations in ion channels and variability in the way that pain messages are modulated in the central nervous system all have been implicated in neuropathic pain. The burden of chronic neuropathic pain seems to be related to the complexity of neuropathic symptoms, poor outcomes and difficult treatment decisions.

Cardiolipin is an inner mitochondrial membrane phospholipid. We found that rotenone, staurosporine, 6-hydroxydopamine and other pro-mitophagy stimuli caused externalization of cardiolipin to the mitochondrial surface in primary cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y cells. RNAi knockdown of cardiolipin synthase or of phospholipid scramblase-3, which transports cardiolipin to the outer mitochondrial membrane, decreased the delivery of mitochondria to autophagosomes. Furthermore, we found that the autophagy protein microtubule-associated-protein-1 light chain 3 (LC3), which mediates both autophagosome formation and cargo recognition, contains cardiolipin-binding sites important for the engulfment of mitochondria by the autophagic system. Mutation of LC3 residues predicted as cardiolipin-interaction sites by computational modelling inhibited its participation in mitophagy.

Its diverse homeostatic roles, particularly in immunology and vascular biology, can go awry in numerous diseases, including multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, and fibrosis. The centrality of S1P signaling has led to the development of several drugs, including two approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis. In a Review, Cartier and Hla discuss the current understanding of how one mediator can carry out so many signaling roles in different tissues, how these become dysregulated in disease, and efforts in drug development to target S1P signaling. Science, this issue p. eaar5551 BACKGROUND Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a product of membrane sphingolipid metabolism, is secreted and acts through G protein–coupled S1P receptors (S1PRs) in vertebrates. S1PR isoforms mediate complex cellular actions either alone or in combination in most organ systems. This stable lysolipid circulates as a complex with protein chaperones that not only enables aqueous solubility but also helps facilitate specific modes of receptor signaling. However, differential concentration gradients of S1P are normally present in various compartments and are perturbed under disease conditions. The abundance of circulatory S1P and the high expression of S1PRs in exposed cells—that is, vascular and hematopoietic cells—poses a key question of how this signaling axis is regulated. This question is of clinical relevance because the first S1PR-targeted drug, fingolimod, has been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis since 2010. Recent findings from basic research as well as insights gleaned from clinical and translational studies have enriched our understanding of how this simple lysolipid evolved as a complex regulator of multiple physiological systems and, when dysregulated, contributes to numerous diseases. ADVANCES Extracellular spatial gradients of S1P, demonstrated by using S1P reporters, are tightly regulated and control fundamental processes such as hematopoietic cell trafficking, immune cell fate, and vascular integrity. The gradients are formed through location-specific function of metabolic enzymes, S1P transporters, and chaperones. Such physiological S1P gradients are altered in diseases, thus contributing to conditions such as inflammation, autoimmunity, and vascular dysfunction. S1P complexed to chaperone proteins—for example, high-density lipoprotein–bound apolipoprotein M—mediate distinct modes of receptor activation, resulting in biased receptor signaling and specific biological outcomes. S1PRs are also regulated tightly through endocytic mechanisms and receptor modulators that enhance or inhibit signal strength and duration. Various signaling mechanisms of this simple lysolipid mediator has helped reveal its multiple actions in the immune system, which include adaptive immune cell localization in various compartments (egress versus retention), fate switching, survival, and activation that influences both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. In the cardiovascular system, high expression of multiple S1PR isoforms in various cell types regulate development, homeostasis, and physiology. Current S1PR-targeted drugs that aim to tame autoimmunity exhibit considerable cardiovascular-adverse events. In the central nervous system (CNS), widespread application of S1PR-targeted drugs in autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases has stimulated research that revealed the broad but poorly understood effects of S1P signaling in neurodevelopment, the neurovascular unit, neurons, and glia. Furthermore, in addition to the involvement of pathological S1P signaling in acute ischemic conditions of various organs, chronic dysregulated S1P signaling has been implicated in fibrotic diseases of lung, heart, liver, and kidney. OUTLOOK Considerable challenges remain to fully harness the new knowledge in S1P pathobiology to translational utility in clinical medicine. Approaches that mimic S1P chaperones, S1P neutralizing agents, modulation of transporters, biased agonists and antagonists of S1PR isotypes, and sphingolipid metabolic enzyme modulators provide viable pathways to therapy. Focusing on the immune system, such approaches may widen the autoimmunity therapeutic landscape and provide new directions in cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. For cardiovascular diseases, ischemic conditions as well as chronic heart failure are likely candidates for future translational efforts. Although further work is needed, S1P-targeted approaches may also be useful in regenerative therapies for the aging and diseased myocardium. The CNS-targeted efforts may cross into neurodegenerative diseases, given the success with S1PR-targeted drugs in reducing brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis. Other potential applications include approaches in pain management and neurodevelopmental disorders. Such strategies, although challenging, are greatly helped by findings from basic research on S1P pathobiology as well as pharmacological and clinical insights derived from the application of S1P-targeted therapeutics. S1PR signaling regulates multiorgan pathophysiological processes. Extracellular S1P gradients created by transporters, chaperones (ApoM+HDL), and metabolic enzymes (LPP3) interact with S1PRs on the cell surface. Receptor activity, transmitted by means of G proteins, is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including β-arrestin coupling, endocytosis, and receptor modulators. The resultant cellular changes influence multiple organ systems in physiology and disease. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a metabolic product of cell membrane sphingolipids, is bound to extracellular chaperones, is enriched in circulatory fluids, and binds to G protein–coupled S1P receptors (S1PRs) to regulate embryonic development, postnatal organ function, and disease. S1PRs regulate essential processes such as adaptive immune cell trafficking, vascular development, and homeostasis. Moreover, S1PR signaling is a driver of multiple diseases. The past decade has witnessed an exponential growth in this field, in part because of multidisciplinary research focused on this lipid mediator and the application of S1PR-targeted drugs in clinical medicine. This has revealed fundamental principles of lysophospholipid mediator signaling that not only clarify the complex and wide ranging actions of S1P but also guide the development of therapeutics and translational directions in immunological, cardiovascular, neurological, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases.",https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/366/6463/eaar5551.full.pdf,

The glucose transporters mediate uptake of d-glucose across the blood-brain barrier and delivery of d-glucose to astrocytes and neurons. They are critically involved in regulatory adaptations to varying energy demands in response to differing neuronal activities and glucose supply. In this review, a comprehensive overview about verified and proposed roles of cerebral glucose transporters during health and diseases is presented. Our current knowledge is mainly based on experiments performed in rodents. First, the functional properties of human glucose transporters expressed in brain and their cerebral locations are described. Thereafter, proposed physiological functions of GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4, and SGLT1 for energy supply to neurons, glucose sensing, central regulation of glucohomeostasis, and feeding behavior are compiled, and their roles in learning and memory formation are discussed. In addition, diseases are described in which functional changes of cerebral glucose transporters are relevant. These are GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-SD), diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). GLUT1-SD is caused by defect mutations in GLUT1. Diabetes and AD are associated with changed expression of glucose transporters in brain, and transporter-related energy deficiency of neurons may contribute to pathogenesis of AD.

Despite millions of people being affected worldwide, there are still no drugs that block the neurodegenerative process to stop or slow disease progression. Neuronal death in these diseases is often linked to the misfolded proteins that aggregate within the brain (proteinopathies) as a result of disease-related gene mutations or abnormal protein homoeostasis. There are two major degradation pathways to rid a cell of unwanted or misfolded proteins to prevent their accumulation and to maintain the health of a cell: the ubiquitin–proteasome system and the autophagy–lysosomal pathway. Both of these degradative pathways depend on the modification of targets with ubiquitin. Aging is the primary risk factor of most neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. With aging there is a general reduction in proteasomal degradation and autophagy, and a consequent increase of potentially neurotoxic protein aggregates of β-amyloid, tau, α-synuclein, SOD1 and TDP-43. An often over-looked yet major component of these aggregates is ubiquitin, implicating these protein aggregates as either an adaptive response to toxic misfolded proteins or as evidence of dysregulated ubiquitin-mediated degradation driving toxic aggregation. In addition, non-degradative ubiquitin signalling is critical for homoeostatic mechanisms fundamental for neuronal function and survival, including mitochondrial homoeostasis, receptor trafficking and DNA damage responses, whilst also playing a role in inflammatory processes. This review will discuss the current understanding of the role of ubiquitin-dependent processes in the progressive loss of neurons and the emergence of ubiquitin signalling as a target for the development of much needed new drugs to treat neurodegenerative disease.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41418-020-00706-7.pdf,

Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the main features of the aging process, particularly in organs requiring a high-energy source such as the heart, muscles, brain, or liver. Neurons rely almost exclusively on the mitochondria, which produce the energy required for most of the cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter synthesis. The brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and damage, because of its high oxygen consumption, low antioxidant defenses, and high content of polyunsaturated fats very prone to be oxidized. Thus, it is not surprising the importance of protecting systems, including antioxidant defenses, to maintain neuronal integrity and survival.

Prevailing views regard tau as a protein that undergoes abnormal phosphorylation prior to its accumulation into the toxic aggregates implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. However, the phosphorylation of tau may, in fact, represent part of the normal but interrupted function and catabolism of the protein.

A holistic appreciation of how these PTMs regulate tau during health and are potentially hijacked in disease remains elusive. Recent studies have reinforced the idea that PTMs play a critical role in tau localization, protein-protein interactions, maintenance of levels, and modifying aggregate structure. These studies also provide tantalizing clues into the possibility that neurons actively choose how tau is post-translationally modified, in potentially competitive and combinatorial ways, to achieve broad, cellular programs commensurate with the distinctive environmental conditions found during development, aging, stress, and disease. Here, we review tau PTMs and describe what is currently known about their functional impacts. In addition, we classify these PTMs from the perspectives of protein localization, electrostatics, and stability, which all contribute to normal tau function and homeostasis. Finally, we assess the potential impact of tau PTMs on tau solubility and aggregation. Tau occupies an undoubtedly important position in the biology of neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to provide an integrated perspective of how post-translational modifications actively, purposefully, and dynamically remodel tau function, clearance, and aggregation. In doing so, we hope to enable a more comprehensive understanding of tau PTMs that will positively impact future studies.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2020.595532/pdf,

To date, however, no early biomarkers or effective therapies exist. It is now clear that brain microglia are more than mere bystanders or amyloid phagocytes; they can act as governors of neuronal function and homeostasis in the adult brain. Here, we highlight the fundamental role of microglia as tissue-resident macrophages in neuronal health. Then, we suggest how chronic impairment in microglia-neuron cross-talk may secure the permanence of the failure of synaptic and neuronal function and health in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Understanding how to assess and modulate microglia-neuron interactions critical for brain health will be key to developing effective therapies for dementia.",https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10113826/1/Hong_abb8587%20copy.pdf,

Lecanemab, an FDA-approved amyloid beta (Aβ)-directed antibody indicated for the treatment of early AD, binds with high affinity to soluble Aβ protofibrils, which have been shown to be more toxic to neurons than monomers or insoluble fibrils. Lecanemab has been shown to be well tolerated in multiple clinical trials, although risks include an increased rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions relative to placebo. Methods Clarity AD was an 18-month treatment (Core study), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with open-label extension (OLE) in participants with early AD. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly). Safety evaluations included monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. ARIA occurrence was monitored throughout the study by magnetic resonance imaging, read both locally and centrally. Results Overall, 1795 participants from Core and 1612 participants with at least one dose of lecanemab (Core + OLE) were included. Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in Clarity AD, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the Core study. There were 9 deaths during the OLE, with 4 deemed possibly related to study treatment. Of the 24 deaths in Core + OLE, 3 were due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): 1 placebo in the Core due to ICH, and 2 lecanemab in OLE with concurrent ICH (1 on tissue plasminogen activator and 1 on anticoagulant therapy). In the Core + OLE, the most common adverse events in the lecanemab group (> 10%) were infusion-related reactions (24.5%), ARIA with hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) microhemorrhages (16.0%), COVID-19 (14.7%), ARIA with edema (ARIA-E; 13.6%), and headache (10.3%). ARIA-E and ARIA-H were largely radiographically mild-to-moderate. ARIA-E generally occurred within 3–6 months of treatment, was more common in ApoE e4 carriers (16.8%) and most common in ApoE ε4 homozygous participants (34.5%). Conclusions Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions, ARIA-H, ARIA-E. Clinicians, participants, and caregivers should understand the incidence, monitoring, and management of these events for optimal patient care.

Most cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), are infiltrated by PNS neurons, and this contributes to the complex tumour microenvironment (TME)1,2. However, neuronal cell bodies reside in various PNS ganglia, far from the tumour mass. Thus, cancer-innervating or healthy-organ-innervating neurons are lacking in current tissue-sequencing datasets. To molecularly characterize pancreas- and PDAC-innervating neurons at single-cell resolution, we developed Trace-n-Seq. This method uses retrograde tracing of axons from tissues to their respective ganglia, followed by single-cell isolation and transcriptomic analysis. By characterizing more than 5,000 individual sympathetic and sensory neurons, with about 4,000 innervating PDAC or healthy pancreas, we reveal novel neuronal cell types and molecular networks that are distinct to the pancreas, pancreatitis, PDAC or melanoma metastasis. We integrate single-cell datasets of innervating neurons and the TME to establish a neuron–cancer–microenvironment interactome, delineate cancer-driven neuronal reprogramming and generate a pancreatic-cancer nerve signature. Pharmacological denervation induces a pro-inflammatory TME and increases the effectiveness of immune-checkpoint inhibitors. The taxane nab-paclitaxel causes intratumoral neuropathy, which attenuates PDAC growth and, in combination with sympathetic denervation, results in synergistic tumour regression. Our multi-dimensional data provide insights into the networks and functions of PDAC-innervating neurons, and support the inclusion of denervation in future therapies. A technique that combines retrograde axon tracing with single-cell transcriptomics is used to characterize neurons innervating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and healthy pancreas, providing insight into the role of neural connections in cancer progression.",,
